The club's Thursday night run will return to the Mug Run starting on Thursday 12th April 2018, continuing every Thursday through the Spring & Summer.

Meet on the corner by Claines Church & the The Mug House at 6:50pm for 7pm (start on the chimes of the clock).

Regular 4.8 mile loop around the beautiful lanes, fields & along the old Droitwich canal. Many try to make it back before the 45 minute chimes, but all abilities are welcome. [View the route](https://www.plotaroute.com/route/333446).

There is also usually a jog-walk group leaving at the same time on a shorter route.

After the run, many stay for a well deserved drink in the lovely gardens of the Mug House. Please be respectful of the other patrons and bring a change of clothes if you're muddy/sweaty/wet.

Please park along the road toward the bridge over the A449 (School Bank) rather than outside the pub. The postcode is WR3 7RW.

The route can get muddy and uneven, so please take care. Trail shoes are advisable.
