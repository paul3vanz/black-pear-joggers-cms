As you may have seen/heard today, Phil Miles will be stepping down from his role leading the Tuesday and Sunday club runs after the 15th April.

At the Post Marathon Celebration Meal at Perdiswell Harvester on Monday 30th April 2018, the BPJ Committee will be presenting Phil with a thank you gift.

However, we are sure that club members would also like to contribute to a gift for Phil to show appreciation for the hard work and time he has put in to grow the Tuesday and Sunday club runs, supporting many through their marathon training and ensuring Tuesdays have a wide range of group leaders.

So if you would like to contribute, please pass this on to a committee member between now and Saturday 28th April at one of the club runs or parkrun.

The Tuesday and Sunday club runs will still continue to take place at the usual times.

All the best,

Paul Evans Chairman Black Pear Joggers
