​​Today being World Mental Health Day seems a fitting time to give a mention to our club's [Mental Health Champions](http://bpj.org.uk/meet-the-joggers/) and some of the work they've been doing recently to promote mental health awareness and the benefit running can have on mental health, including as part of [England Athletics' **#runandtalk** campaign](https://www.englandathletics.org/clubs--community/mental-wellbeing/runandtalk). This has included a #runandtalk event at [Worcester parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/worcester/), a [20 minute interview](https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/play/p06kyp08) on BBC Hereford and Worcester and will finish with a [#chipandchat social event](https://www.facebook.com/events/339675726577374/) on Monday.

Glenn Barker, Alison Law, James Matheson, Kaine Pritchett and Megan Judge are there to encourage everyone to talk about mental health, supporting members, and share their own experiences, helping to remove the stigma of mental health issues. Much of the great work they do happens quietly behind the scenes, supporting many of the club's members, building on the club's friendly and inclusive ethos. You can see the club's Mental Health Champions on most club nights in their bright new running gilets provided by the club.

## Radio interview

Last Friday on BBC Hereford and Worcester's Evening Show with Kate Justice, Glenn and Alison were interviewed by Kate Justice. The pair did a fantastic job, sharing their own experiences and promoting the #runandtalk programme, even getting in a plug for the Couch to 5K programme starting next Monday and Tuesday at the club. It was truly inspiring listening to their interview, which you can listen through the BBC radio player online. I highly recommend you take a listen:

Skip to the following parts to hear them:

- **Part one:** 14:18 to 21:35
- **Part two:** 44:20 to 50:35
- **Part three:** 1:16:29 to 1:22:00

## Run and talk

Following that, the MHC team ran a **#runandtalk** event at last Saturday's Worcester parkrun. The team ran with many people, listening to and sharing experiences of mental health issues and the hearing the reasons why they run.

## Chip and chat

Next, the MHCs are hosting a **#chipandchat** night this coming Monday (15th October) where we will also be handing over cheques to the club's nominated charities for all the fundraising over the last year including this year's [Wild One](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/wild-race/) race. We'd love to see you there.
