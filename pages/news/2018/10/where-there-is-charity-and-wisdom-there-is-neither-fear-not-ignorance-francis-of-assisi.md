**![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/YSS-795x401.png)Worcestershire Young Carers** has been successfully delivered by YSS since 2003. The service is commissioned by Worcestershire County Council to provide assessment, signposting, one to one support and monthly youth clubs for young people with a caring role at home, aged between seven and 17, who live in Worcestershire. Additionally, the service provides support to young people aged between 18 and 25 who are considered young adult carers. The caring role could be for a parent, a sibling or a grandparent due to illness, disability, physical or mental health difficulties or substance misuse.

Did you know that on average, homeless people die at just 47 years old? People sleeping on the street are almost 17 times more likely to have been victims of violence. Homeless people are over nine times more likely to take their own life than the general population. Maggs provide a day centre service 5 days a week in Worcester, food, shower, laundry facilities as well as a clothing project and health care to those who need it most, but more than that, Maggs Day Centre is a place where homeless people can come to escape from social isolation. Moreover there is coaching, support and mentoring to reintegrate back into society.

Cheques were aptly presented at the Mental Health #ChipAndChat session at The Old Elizabethan’s Cricket Club on Monday 15th October. We were also even able to donate leftover bread and butter to Maggs which went down very well.
