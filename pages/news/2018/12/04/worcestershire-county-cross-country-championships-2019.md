Entries for the County Cross Country Championships on 5th January 2019 are now open.  We are hoping to enter men's and women's teams.  Details of eligibility to run, start times and distances are [here](https://www.worcaa.org.uk/fixtures/xc/?fbclid=IwAR3zaeqqRhjTtJBgsKTcSm2lHXUIzxMvtlykdmH0vlEW9WoorDt-aYHsyI4) and information about the course. The cost is £7 each. If anyone wants to run could you let me have your money, DOB, EA number & whether you're eligible, due to birth or residency within the county, by Saturday 15th December please. If you've ran for Ladies' Team before I already have your details, so will just need your £7.
