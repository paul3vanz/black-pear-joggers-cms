Derek Jackson and his team will be running a repeat of the parkrun Improvers Course on Monday evenings for 10 sessions from 18 February 2019.  If you are interested in taking part then you should be able to run a parkrun/5k/10k comfortably but feel you can still do better.  Your actual time is not important as the course can cater for a wide range of abilities. 

There are 20 places available.  Please reply by email if you are interested – clubmark@bpj.org.uk.  If the course is over-subscribed, names will be drawn from a hat.

We can all run faster than our 5k/10k pace, but over shorter distances.  The course will give you the opportunity to push yourself over progressively increasing distances to help you aim for a PB at the end.  There will be coaching on a number of aspects of running and the course will also show you how to continue to improve after the course has finished.

It is important to bear in mind that you are responsible for the pace you run at and for the effort you put in.  An injured runner is a non-runner so, while we expect you to try as hard as you reasonably can, we recognise all runners are individuals and we do not want you to push yourself beyond your limits.

**Entries will close on Friday 18th January 2019**
