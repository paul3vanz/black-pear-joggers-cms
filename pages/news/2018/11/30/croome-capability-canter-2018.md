![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Drabble-795x516.jpg)For those not already in the know, Croome Capability Canter is a 10k(ish) trail run in the scenic Croome Park, ![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Newey.jpg)a National Trust property. It provides a superb opportunity for runners of all abilities to enjoy the beautiful scenery, undulations and occasional mud / fog / cows / sheep / herons right on our Worcestershire doorstep.

Sunday 25th November 2018 saw the usual autumnal / winter weather, but volunteers from the club were out en masse across the course, at registration, a dedicated tail runner, on car parking duty and generally anywhere where help was required.  Apart from the minor safety pin incident, all went incredibly smoothly.

The race was won **Nick Drabble** a BPJ in a time of 0:39.32. A total of 54 Black Pears took part and we managed to bagsy both 1st and 2nd male and female places.
