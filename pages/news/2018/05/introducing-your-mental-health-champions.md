As Mental Health Awareness Week draws to a close. We would like to take this opportunity to introduce to you our new club Mental Health Champions.

Following a much-needed rethink by England Athletics, the Mental Health Ambassador programme has finished and now being relaunched as the #runandtalk programme with Mental Health Champions supporting the aims of the programme:

- Promote mental wellbeing through running by supporting the aims of #runandtalk
- Work with their club/group to support its members to improve their mental health through running.
- Support new people who are experiencing mental health problems to start running, get back into running, or continue running.
