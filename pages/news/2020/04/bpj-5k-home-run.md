The BPJ Mental Health Champions want to introduce, the BPJ 5k Home Run.

To participate all you need to do is run 5k, as you would a parkrun, anytime on a Saturday.

You will need to upload your run to strava or similar and send us your time with proof of upload to anita.j.hennessey@gmail.com.

There will be a male and female Lockdown League for paid up BPJs with acknowledgements for PBs also.

You should run from your home or as close to it as possible,and keep to the same route each week, starting and finishing at the same place.

We hope this will be both a bit of run and have a virtual parkrun feel during lockdown.

It would be great if we could all wear our vests and take pictures, but that isnâ€™t mandatory.

Happy home running
