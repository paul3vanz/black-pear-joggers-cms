During the lockdown, the club's Mental Health Champions and Committee have been busy creating some challenges to keep members motivated while we wait for the return of club runs, parkruns and races.

While you're recovering from the [5K Home Run](https://bpj.org.uk/2020/04/bpj-5k-home-run/), the [Easter Scavenger Hunt](https://bpj.org.uk/2020/04/easter-scavenger-hunt/) and the [Magic/Tragic Mile](https://www.facebook.com/groups/blackpearjoggers/?post_id=10157171360853309), why not give the **Black Pear Lockdown Crossword** a go? All the answers are related to either running, Worcester or the club.

The black squares are spaces where answers are multiple words if it wasn't clear.

Complete the crossword and send the answers by **6pm** on **Friday 24th April 2020** (a week away). You can either print it off and send a scan/photo or write your answers in a list and email it to [webmaster@bpj.org.uk](mailto:webmaster@bpj.org.uk) with your name.

I'll follow up shortly after with a hall of fame of those that completed it correctly and a one random lucky member will receive a prize.

Good luck,
