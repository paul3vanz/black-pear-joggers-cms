It may feel like an eternity since your last race or parkrun and I hope you're still finding motivation to keep your running going (following government guidelines of course). Now might be a useful time to look back and reflect on your achievements and think about your goals post-lockdown.

If you've previously checked out the [race results section of the site](https://black-pear-joggers.netlify.app/apps/race-results/), you may notice some **new changes**. If you've never been there before, then go and take a look. Essentially for all club members we take a feed of the information from the [Power of 10](https://www.thepowerof10.info/) and [runbritain rankings](https://www.runbritainrankings.com/) site, along with our own club magic mile results.

This is then used to show your ranking, personal best and race history, how your performances grade against the club standard awards and whether you hold any club records. Check out an overview of all the features below.

I hope you find the information useful. If you have any suggestions on improvements or have any questions, [drop me an email](mailto:webmaster@bpj.org.uk) or ask on the club [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/blackpearjoggers/). There's a few caveats if what you're seeing doesn't look right. This is all explained on the race results section though.

Happy running.

## Your runbritain ranking

Visit the [runbritain rankings](https://www.runbritainrankings.com/) site if you've no idea what this is; for keen golfers, it's like a handicap score (36 to zero - or lower for the super fast runners). Click the logo to visit your runbritain rankings profile where you can register or sign in and add any missing performances. This is useful if it's not picked up your parkrun results.

## Proud of your PBs

Here you'll find your PBs over the common race distances that count towards the [club standards awards](https://black-pear-joggers.netlify.com/apps/club-standards/); Mile, 5K (including parkrun), 10K, Half Marathon and Marathon.

## Chart your progress

The latest new feature is a chart showing your ranking history alongside your personal bests (PBs). Each dot is a PB, so you can see your improvement over time.

## Effect of PBs on ranking

You can see the effect your PBs have on your runbritain ranking. Here it shows where the 5K PB was set twice in a short period of time, it had a noticeable improvement in their ranking.

## Pace improvement

Each line in the chart is based on the average pace, so you can visualise how your pace has improved over time. Here it shows where the runner now can run a 10K at a faster pace than what used to be their 5K PB pace. Hover over any of the results to see the pace and event details.

## Record setting

If you hold any club records, these will be shown.
