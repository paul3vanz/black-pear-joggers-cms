This month, your Mental Health Champions are launching our “Easter Scavenger Hunt”

It’s just a little bit of fun  
To enjoy whilst on your run

Simply find the items in the boxes whilst out on your run and tick them off ✅ Photo evidence/Selfies will be required here.  
The items spell out  
‘BLACK PEARS STAY SAFE THIS EASTER’

It may be an idea to limit yourself to a couple items per run so that you don’t complete it too quickly.

Always remember to follow the government guidance on social distancing.

We look forward to hearing how you’re getting on and seeing your photos ?

Stay Safe & have fun ??‍♀️
