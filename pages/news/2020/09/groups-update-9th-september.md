Following the [latest government coronavirus briefing](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-outbreak-faqs-what-you-can-and-cant-do/coronavirus-outbreak-faqs-what-you-can-and-cant-do), we are awaiting clarification from England Athletics on what this means for the club.

Currently, all BPJ activities follow the Covid secure guidelines issued by the government and England Athletics to reduce the risk of infection. A range of pace groups are available throughout the week and can be [booked on with the Wix app](https://bpj.org.uk/2020/07/bpj-group-runs-now-available/), with group sizes from 6 to 10.

Our understanding so far, which is backed up by [British Triathlon's latest announcement](https://www.britishtriathlon.org/news/british-triathlon-statement-_14295) that triathlon training activities can continue, is that we should be able to continue as we are, in line with other [organised sporting activities](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-outbreak-faqs-what-you-can-and-cant-do/coronavirus-outbreak-faqs-what-you-can-and-cant-do#when-can-i-gather-in-groups-of-more-than-6) as long as we continue to maintain a Covid secure environment.

So for now, there are no further changes to how BPJ group runs operate.

We will keep you updated with any further changes as we know more.
