As part of your walks or runs around Worcester, find as many street names as you can that contain animals. You have until the end of June.

Photographic evidence required.

Extra awards for best animal costume at an animal street sign, (or at home if you aren’t quite brave enough), best animal pose, best animal pose or costume as a family and best dressed pet and owner.

An extra addition to the animal challenge is most animals photographed during daily exercise.

Please adhere to social distancing guidelines at all times. If you are photographing someone’s pet whilst out, please ask permission and please keep to the social distance.

Post your results to the club [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/blackpearjoggers/) or email to [webmaster@bpj.org.uk](mailto:webmaster@bpj.org.uk). Let us know if you don't want us to put them on the BPJ website along with everyone else's.
