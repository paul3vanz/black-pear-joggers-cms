Due to the coronavirus pandemic, we’re unable to run our usual Wild One event. As an alternative, to support the charities and offer something fun, we’re running the [Virtual One](https://bpj.org.uk/the-virtual-wild-one/) instead throughout July.

On your own or split the distance in a team, complete the marathon distance (26.2 miles) throughout July. Run it or walk it. Send us proof. Earn the medal.

You have the whole of July to complete the distance. You could run or walk 2.62 miles a day over 10 days, run a half marathon together with a friend (2 metres apart of course), team up with four others and run 5.24 miles each or head out and run 26.2 miles in one go. The choice is up to you.

All profits will be split between two fantastic Worcester-based charities; **New Hope** and **St. Richard’s Hospice**. These charities need your help as much as ever. Due to the lockdown, they’re unable to carry out much of their fundraising events.
