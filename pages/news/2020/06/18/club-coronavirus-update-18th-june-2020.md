Dear member,

Since our last club coronavirus update, [England Athletics have issued further guidance](https://www.englandathletics.org/athletics-and-running/news/guidance-update-step-2/) for running clubs based on the easing of lockdown restrictions.

Groups of up to 6 people can now train outdoors providing runners maintain social distancing advice i.e. 2 metres apart if from a different household.This is a great step forward but gatherings of more than 6 people are still not permitted so club activities are still suspended.

The committee have been discussing how we can safely hold club events in the future, so that we are ready as restrictions ease further. We have put together a risk assessment to help manage and reduce the potential risks, please take a look over and if you have any helpful suggestions or feedback, please get in touch:

If you are looking for some company for a run and want to reach out on the club Facebook group, please remember that the group is open to more than just club members. Don't publicise any meeting times and locations on the group - use Messenger, WhatsApp, SMS, etc. It's always wise to follow other [safety advice](https://bpj.org.uk/2019/07/incident-on-pitchcroft/), which we have previously shared on the website.

We will continue to monitor the latest advice and as the situation changes, we will keep you updated accordingly.

Please stay safe and happy running everyone!

Mark, Claire, Nick, Glyn, Ruth, Michelle, Avril, Gay, Steve, Stuart, Jo and Paul  
**The BPJ Committee**
