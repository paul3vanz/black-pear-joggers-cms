As a club we are being responsible and following government guidelines around organised activities and social distancing. It is really important to remember that many of us run for our mental health. Isolation can be difficult so your Mental Health Champions have come up with a few ideas to keep your running and exercise varied and hopefully fun in lieu of club runs, parkruns and races.

Today we are launching our MAXIMISING MARCH bingo game - no prizes unfortunately but hopefully some fun for people to participate in and share their successes on social media. Some of these require photographic evidence! Simply tick them off as you complete them.

**\* If you are 40 you run 5.40 miles  
\*\* Ideal opportunity to get your young people involved**

IMPORTANT: Please remember that you can still run solo or if you are running with someone please respect the guidance on social distancing and take appropriate precautions around hygiene.

Please feel free to adapt this challenge (e.g. if you can't get to Rainbow Hill choose a suitable alternative)

We will be also supplying some suggestions for stretching, yoga, HIIT, and strengthening work over the next few days.

On your "rest day" why not try something mindful. Write a letter, draw a picture, pick up the phone or video call anyone you know who may be self isolating.

We would love to hear how you get on
