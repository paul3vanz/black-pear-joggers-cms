We're pleased to announce the return of BPJ group runs. There are now a range of groups available for members to book on to using the new **Wix** app (instructions below).

As the club is following current government recommendations and England Athletics advice that groups should be limited to no more than 6 people, normal club runs are not yet available. However, group leaders will now be taking a range of pace groups throughout the week starting from different times and locations. The group should ensure they're following social distancing guidance.

After researching potential systems that will allow the safe meeting of members, we’ve set up on the Wix platform. Using the app:

- Members can easily see a list of groups available
- Leaders can list their own groups at times and locations to suit them
- Members can potentially find groups closer to them
- Locations can be kept private and sent out to the runners beforehand
- Numbers in a group can be limited to 6 (the leader plus 5 runners)
- Members can get in touch with the group leader to ask any questions
- Members can easily book and cancel a place on a group

This is a trial, so please bear with us as there may be some teething problems. Booking via a web page will be available soon for any members without a smartphone. We would [appreciate any feedback](mailto:webmaster@bpj.org.uk) once you’ve tried it out.

## Using the app

The app should be relatively straight-forward to use, but here's some screenshots of what to expect.

We'd recommend pressing the Change link and setting your name, so group leaders know who you are. You can do this after in your profile.

## Feedback

Thank you to Laura Plummer for suggesting this platform, the committee for helping set it all up and test it, as well as the group leaders for putting themselves forward to take groups.

We hope that this is positive for many who have missed out running with some company or struggled to motivate themselves to get out running.

All the best,

Mark, Claire, Nick, Glyn, Ruth, Michelle, Avril, Gay, Steve, Stuart, Jo and Paul  
**BPJ Committee**
