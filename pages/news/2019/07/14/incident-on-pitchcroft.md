Earlier today the club received report of an incident at Pitchcroft earlier this afternoon:

> Just been sexually assaulted during a run at Pitchcroft. Gang of young men on bikes grabbed my bottom and then continued to cycle alongside clearly trying to frighten me. Have made a tearful, confused and probably a bit useless statement to police. Please keep an eye out for them fellow Worcester runners. Not a nice bunch to meet on your weekend run.

In light of the post, here is some probably quite obvious but important advice.

Worcester is a vibrant city offering diversity in sporting activities. The Black Pear Joggers feel that people should continue to enjoy their activities without fear. Becky, the club’s previous welfare officer, shared some advice for maintaining personal safety when similar attacks occurred last year.

1. Know your route/surroundings.
2. Share your route and estimated return time with somebody.
3. Change your routine: Don’t keep to the same routes and times.  
    
4. Run with a friend or in groups where possible.  
    
5. Avoid running alone in secluded areas or unlit areas.  
    
6. Stay aware. Avoid use of headphones and MP3 players.  
    
7. Carry a mobile phone.  
    
8. If approached, do not confront the attacker.  
    
9. Get help at the earliest opportunity.  
    

If anyone feels unsafe due to recent events they can run in company with the Black Pear Joggers as we have club runs most days. Please keep vigilant, not just along the Riverside, in case the perpetrators change their predatory ground.

If you feel concerned or would like some extra advice, please contact either **Ruth Bennett** (the club’s welfare officer) or **Mark Dillon** (the club chairman) via the [contact](https://bpj.org.uk/contact-the-club/) page where you can lodge a welfare enquiry, our dedicated Facebook Group, or by approaching us in person.  

You can also check the [When We Run](https://bpj.org.uk/when-we-run/) page for details of group runs.
