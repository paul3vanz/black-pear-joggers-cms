I am delighted to post the design of the medal for those people who complete the Black Pears challenge. 

The Black Pears challenge is to complete a parkrun beginning with each of the **‘Black Pears’** letters between 1 January and 31 December this year. For example, the BPJ trip to Pontypool on 13 July will count as a P.

Any parkrun in any country will count. A parkrun beginning with A (say Arrow Valley) will count twice.

The medals have been ordered and are in limited supply. The numbers are strictly limited to the first 100 people who complete this challenge. While I feel that this should easily cover everybody who wishes to complete the challenge, we need to ensure that the club isn’t left with 100s of unclaimed medals!

The plan is to hand out the medals before the club runs on Mondays and Tuesdays, commencing on Monday 30th September.

Please note that if you run a parkrun on the Saturday, then the result will not appear in Run Britain Rankings until late afternoon on the Monday.

I will also need to give time to process the results and confirm who are eligible. Therefore, there will likely be a one week time delay between completing the challenge and receiving your medal. Please be patient with us!

Don’t forget that this is all a bit of fun. I hope you enjoy completing this challenge as much as I will do.
