It is that time of year again...

The Black Pear coaches will be holding Marathon Training drop in sessions at the Perdiswell Harvester on Monday 14th January from 8pm for anyone who would like support with training, training plans or nutrition.

If you have any specific questions or want support with something in particular feel free to email to give us a chance to prepare resources for you - clubmark@bpj.org.uk

We look forward to seeing some of you there and wish everyone training for a marathon a fantastic experience.
