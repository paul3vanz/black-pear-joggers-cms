On **Monday 8th June**, the club have organised a training evening with Liz Yelling, winner of a Bronze medal in the Commonwealth Games marathon and double Olympian (view Liz's impressive stats on her [Power of 10 Profile](http://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=1811)).

The evening is priced at **£5 per person** and is limited to 60.  The evening will commence at **7pm**, at Perdiswell Sports Centre, with a practical session on the adjoining field for approximately an hour followed by a Q&A session upstairs in the bar area.

If you would like to attend this event, please purchase a wristband from **Steve Jones** on a Monday club night or send a message on the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1452105875083596/). The event is subsidised by the club so it is only open to paid-up BPJ members.

The club would like to stress that all abilities are welcome.
