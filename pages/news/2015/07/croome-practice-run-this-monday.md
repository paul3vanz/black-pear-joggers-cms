This Monday (13th July 2015) we will be running our summer practice run at [Croome Park](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/croome/) instead of Perdiswell. This gives the chance for all the club members that help at the Croome Race in November to be able to enjoy the scenic route.

There is a suggested donation of £1 for all that attend, to help support the National Trust maintain Croome, so that we can continue to run here.

The run will start at 7pm prompt, please arrive no later than 6:45pm so you can hear the pre-run briefing (we don't want you to end up being lost in the grounds!). There should be a range of paces on offer, although some of the slower pace groups may not run the full 6.5 miles due to time.

There are currently some road works affecting the journey over there, so please read the following advice from the National Trust and please try to car share where possible as parking is limited:

**Notice**: A road leading to Croome off the A38 is closed for repairs from 8 June until September. Please follow the diversion routes in place which should only add 10-15 minutes onto your travel time. If you are travelling from the M5 your route is unaffected - please alight at J7, follow the signs to Pershore and then follow the brown signs to Croome.

We will also be going to the pub after for drinks at the [Rose and Crown](http://rosecrownworcesterpub.co.uk/) in Severn Stoke (postcode WR8 9JA).

The actual Croome Capability Canter race will be on Sunday, 29th November 2015.
