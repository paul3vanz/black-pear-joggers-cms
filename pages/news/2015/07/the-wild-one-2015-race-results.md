## The Wild One 2015

This year's charity race [The Wild One](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/wild-race/) certainly lived up to its name this year!

Less than a week before the event, a group of travellers [set up camp at Perdiswell Park](http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/13424368._quot_Selfish_quot__travellers_put_Perdiswell_hospice_fundraising_marathon_in_doubt/), leaving the event in danger of being cancelled due to health and safety concerns.

The club struggled to find an alternative location at such short notice, but with the help of club members rallying together, Worcester's [Bishops Perowne C of E College](http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/13462430.Charity_running_event_put_in_doubt_by_travellers__presence_is_saved_by_Worcester_school/) kindly offered the use of their grounds.

In order to prepare the route, there was a significant amount of help needed to clear overgrown branches, brambles and greenery. In true BPJ spirit, a large group of club members came armed with hedge trimmers, strimmers, chainsaws and secateurs and spent hours making the route clear and safe for race day.

## Race day

On race day, the kids race went smooth with 32 kids aged between 2 and 12 completing the race.

The main race saw 186 runners, consisting of 35 solos, 10 pairs and 27 teams in various club tops and fancy dress costumes take part.

Although we had to shorten the route to 1.31 mile loops, the overwhelming feedback was great as the solo runners got more support on the course and didn't have to carry water and gels round the route. This also meant the teams of five could do single laps, resulting in some very fast times.

Solo runner [Paul Nicholls kindly wrote](http://www.sandbachstriders.co.uk/2015/07/race-report-wild-one.html) "the race was great and the people fantastic" and "the running club are and were a really friendly bunch and gave great encouragement throughout the day".

Dave Phillips from Massey Ferguson, another solo runner commented "everyone plus the marshals chatted to you, encouraged you, wished you well etc. Oh so friendly. BUT oh so tough".
