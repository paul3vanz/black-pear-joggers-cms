It was a cold, wet and windy Monday evening when we went down to do the magic mile in the opposite direction!

We had a few first timers, I think a few surprised themselves with their times!

We also had a few just to pace others and to give some support!!

Sorry if I have any names or times wrong the rain got to the paperwork.

A huge well done to all who came to join us!!

These are the predicted and actual times I had , if there are any missing please let us know and we will update them.
