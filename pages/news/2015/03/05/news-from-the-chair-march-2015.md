Spring is here!

Good news for some people I would imagine, training should become easier for us all with the lighter nights approaching.

Well done all first timers who have now completed their first ½ marathon.  With the miles in your legs it’s a great time to start planning for your next achievement.

## Cross Country

I would also like to say well done to the men’s [cross country](https://bpj.org.uk/leagues/cross-country/ "Cross Country") team who got promoted to division two of the Birmingham league and the 3 ladies who were placed 3rd in the Gloucester road relay race under the watchful eye of General John Potts.

## Memberships are due for renewal

March is the time of the year when club subscription is due. You can either [fill in the form online](https://bpj.org.uk/membership/ "Membership") and pay via PayPal or fill in a paper copy and hand it over with your payment to any of the committee members over the next month. I would like to ask you to do this ASAP as this makes Catherine’s job as club membership secretary a lot easier. THANKYOU

## Friends of Perdiswell

As some of you may be aware the club have been asked to join the [Friends of Perdiswell](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Friends-of-Perdiswell-Park/1605991276282115) group. This gives us a voice in local matters around the park area.  As we are one of the largest groups to use the area to get the ball rolling I volunteered our members to conduct a litter pick.  I was overwhelmed with the support we got for this with over 40 people taking part.  Thanks to all.  This group is also looking at ways of improving the footpaths and usage of the area.  If you would like to get involved please speak to me.

## Herefordshire and Worcestershire Athletics Network

The club welcomed Richard Warder who is [Herefordshire and Worcestershire Athletics Network](http://www.hwan.org.uk/) Coordinator. He gave an informative talk on marathon running/training which was well attended. We are in talks with Richard to have a few follow-up sessions giving us a chance to try out some drills /speed type sessions at the end of March.

## Charity

And finally the club last year raised just short of £5000 for charity and I would like to thank you all for your support in raising this fantastic amount. Let’s try to do the same or more this coming year.

Enjoy your running

Mike
