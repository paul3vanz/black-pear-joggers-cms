On **Friday 20th March**, starting at **5pm**, Black Pear Jogger Andrew 'Dodsy' Graham will be running a 24hr jogathon around the perimeter of Worcester, starting and finishing at the Cathedral Cross. He is fundraising for Worldwide Cancer Research, himself a cancer survivor.

> We've all been touched by cancer. We all know someone who has suffered the heartache and anxiety, either directly or indirectly. I'm a survivor and I know how valuable research is so I'm just trying to do my bit! - Andrew 'Dodsy' Graham

The Black Pear Joggers will be supporting Dodsy in his fantastic challenge by having a manned support/refreshment table at Perdiswell Leisure Centre throughout (with their kind permission).

I am organising a rota of support, so if you are available and want to help please email me your details to [kit@blackpearjoggers.org.uk](mailto:kit@blackpearjoggers.org.uk).  We are looking for people to cheer, refreshments, gels, and anything else you can offer to support.

Text **DODS88 £3** to **70070** to sponsor Dodsy and help make a difference.

Dodsy's intended route takes him along New Road into St John's, Malvern Road, bypass, Bath Road, Diglis, along the River onto the Tything, Bilford Road, Rainbow Hill, City Walls and the Cathedral.
