It's that time of year again... Membership renewals are now due by **31st March** for the **2015/16** membership year. If you've already renewed, thank you.

If you haven't renewed, please do so, we have online membership renewal facilities so it only takes a few minutes to do.

Please note if you have not renewed yet: In order to be eligible for club **London Marathon ballot** places, as well as the usual criteria, you will need to have renewed your membership by the deadline to be eligible. 

Standard affiliated membership is only **£20** a year, which works out at only £1.66 a month. Basic membership is also available for **£10** for those that aren't interested in entering any races. More information about the different [membership levels](https://bpj.org.uk/membership/) can be found online.

_If you no longer wish to renew your BPJ membership, please [let the club know](https://bpj.org.uk/contact-the-club/ "Contact the Club")._

Here's what you need to do to join or renew:

## 1) Renew your details

First, complete the [online membership form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1A_BKah_NKhvH2WdEFLn3SXdAq8F5iFo1cCXTC9XxCeg/viewform) so we have up to date information and emergency contact details.

Alternatively, you can [print a membership form](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/BPJ-Membership-Application-Form-2016-v1.pdf) (there's plenty printed by the notice board at Perdiswell) to bring to the club in person or post with your fees.
