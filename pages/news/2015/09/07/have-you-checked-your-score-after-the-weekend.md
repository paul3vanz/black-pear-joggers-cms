Have you checked your runbritain score yet? If you raced a UKA recognised race this weekend then see if it's improved your score.

Some selected examples:

Jemima Lowe's score improved to **9.8** this weekend after a good parkrun. It may have gone unnoticed but Richard Walsh won Tewkesbury parkrun on Saturday well done! Ranking improved to **3.2** and Jason Green Improved to **15.4** after his fastest Worcester parkrun since November :-)
