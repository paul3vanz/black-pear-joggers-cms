How do I improve my [runbritainrankings.com](http://www.runbritainrankings.com/) score? Enter UKA affliated races such as your local parkrun. Harder courses have a higher SSS (Difficulty) rating so a good time on there will improve your ranking more than the same time on an "easier" course.

Check all your performances have been updated to your profile - Occasionally some race results don't get applied to your profile - for example Pershore 10k last weekend. See if the race is in your performance listings - if not go to the bottom of your races and click on the tab marked "add performances" select 10k and 2015 then Pershore 10k from the list.
