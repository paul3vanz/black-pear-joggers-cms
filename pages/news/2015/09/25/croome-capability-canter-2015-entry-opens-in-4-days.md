Voted into the top 10 off-road races by readers of Runners World, the [Croome Capability Canter](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/croome-race/) is a 6.5 mile (10kish) multi-terrain race around the scenic Croome Park; designed by renowned 18th century landscape architect Lancelot “Capability” Brown. The 2015 race will be on **Sunday, 29th November 2015** at 9:30am.

Last year, entries sold out in less than 4 days, so this year we are giving advanced notice of when entries open, so you can set your alarms!

Entries will open **Tuesday 29th September** at **9pm** and will be online only (no postal or on the day entries). Places are strictly limited to **300** to protect the parkland, so we recommend booking quickly to avoid missing out.

We are always grateful for marshals on the day. If you would like to volunteer (lunch and cake provided!), please [get in touch](https://bpj.org.uk/contact-the-club/).
