How tough was your last race? A good time on a tough course often scores better than a fast time on an easy course on [runbritainrankings.com](http://www.runbritainrankings.com/). Scroll down to your previous races and click on the column marked SSS this will rank your races depending on how tough they have been graded. For example Worcester parkrun is usually graded between 1.5 and 2.5 depending on the course conditions. Evesham parkrun is pancake flat and is graded 1.0; Wyre forest is graded a 3.0 because of the hills.
