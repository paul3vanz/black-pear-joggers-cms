Just a little update for you on the Runbritain improved runners competition....we all know running is a great family sport but it can also be competitive.

Some examples of family rivalries in 2015 Mark Dillon has improved by **1.1** to **18** this year while Benjamin Dillon has also improved by **0.2** to **6.6**. Sue Dillon has also joined the race but didn't start racing until June and is currently level with Mark on **18**.

Elsewhere Jo Evans has improved by **3.0** to **28.6** while Paul Evans has improved to **1.0** to **6.9**.

Mudball Nick has improved **0.2** to **10.8** while his better half Kate Eacock **2.7** to **20.8**.

So many people improving its great (even if my score has gone backwards!)
