We need your help... We use the facilities around Perdiswell Park and the Leisure Centre all year round free of charge. We also use the field for the Wild race, which helps raise lots for charity. So let's pay something back; Please spare an hour or two on February 28th to help litter pick around the Park. The council will be providing us with litter pickers and bags. Meet at the leisure centre at **10:30am**.

Bethan Stimson and Jenni Morris are also organising a charity ball on the 28th, raising money for Children with Cancer. The ball is at Norton Parish Hall. Starting at **7pm**, there will be a welcome drink, 2 course dinner, raffle, auction and live band. Dress code is black tie. Tickets are Â£30 and available from Bethan and Jenni.
