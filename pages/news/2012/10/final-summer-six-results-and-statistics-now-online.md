![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/perdiswell-golf-course-300x244.jpg "Perdiswell Golf Course")The results for the 6th and final Summer Six race are now online. Head on over to the [Summer Six results](https://bpj.org.uk/summer-six-results/ "Summer Six Results") page to see the results.

We have also added various statistics so you can see your improvement and what the fastest times were, who had the biggest improvement.

The Summer Six runs gave BPJ members an opportunity to try a timed 5k or 10k run around the Perdiswell Golf Course, a scenic off-road course, with free chips in the bar afterwards!

Well done everyone who took part and a big thank you to Gavin Paskin and Stuart Wild who organised it, as well as all those that helped with registrations, marshalling and other duties.

If you spot any mistakes on the results, please [email](mailto:webmaster@blackpearjoggers.org.uk) us or let us know on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/6389738308/).
