The Black Pear Joggers celebrated Stuart’s amazing achievement of completing 100 marathons with food and cake in the bar at Perdiswell Leisure Centre. Stuart brought in his rather large collection of medals, including his new ’100 Marathon Club’ medal.

The event was organised by Jo Evans and Emma Bright with some great gifts for Stuart provided by Peter Gilbert and a presentation of a tribute book arranged by Tracy Kennish which had many tributes, photos, stories and poems from the many runners that Stuart has ran with and helped train over the years.

Stuart’s milestone marathon was the Snowdonia marathon, which was Stuart’s 11th time completing the race. Over 40 Black Pear Joggers also ran the marathon, meaning they were the most attended club at the race. Well done to those that helped with the organisation, especially Jo Hooper with the accommodation and Claire Shacklock who arranged some fantastic personalised t-shirts for all the BPJ runners at Snowdon.
