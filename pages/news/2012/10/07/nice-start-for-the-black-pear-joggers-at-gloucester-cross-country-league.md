Black Pear Joggers competed in their first cross country fixture in the Gloucester league (Cotswold Farm Park - 06/10/12).

This was a new venture into cross country and the team adapted themselves to the new tougher terrain very well and even held their own against more established teams.

Darren Salisbury carried the flag for Black Pear Joggers with a very respectful time as the conditions were very tough and totally different to the usual road running that the club is used to.

Black Pear Joggers can be very proud of this team result as we have surpassed very  
established teams such as Gloucester AC, Forest of Dean AC to name but a few.

BPJ's finished 8th overall out of 16 in the team standings and 6th overall in the vets Over 40's.

Results as follows:

- 21st Darren Salisbury – time 33:24
- 33rd Paul Childs – 35:15
- 64th Leonardo Taggio – 36:53
- 87th Clive Andrews – 38:23
- 96th Chris Harris – 38:46
- 111th Mike Lane – 39:47
- 161st David Bessant – 44:55
- 177th Richard Kemp – 46:43

So here’s to a new permanent fixture of cross country running for the club and let’s hope that a lot more of our members come and join in and feel the team spirit. It was certainly a great day out.

The next fixture is on Saturday 3rd November 2012 @ Pittville Park Cheltenham.

The men’s team consists of the first six to cross the line but we want as many people as we can get as most teams were putting out up to three teams.

The ladies team only require three ladies, so I’m sure we could easily put out three teams as we have some good quality ladies at our club.
