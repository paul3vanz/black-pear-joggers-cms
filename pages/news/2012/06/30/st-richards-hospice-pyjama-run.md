Starting at the Anchor in Diglis, the runners visited over a dozen pubs, running from pub to pub with collection buckets, raising funds for the charity - and of course drinking in each pub as well ('cos those are the rules!).

A massive pat on the back to all involved, because we raised an awesome **Â£657.21**. Thank you to everyone who took part and all the generous patrons and members of the public that donated, it is a very worthy cause.
