I would firstly like to welcome you all to the new Website!!

Thanks to all of you for your input into creating a new look and easy to operate website. We look forward to hearing what members think and welcome your feedback through email.

The month of June has just started and Malvern seems to be the place to be. Later on in the month is the Acorn Triple Run and having run this half marathon before I know it to be a great, quick course. Especially if there is no wind blowing at you over the last 5 miles! This race takes place on the 24th.

Before this we have the ever popular midweek Malvern 10km, put on by our friends the Malvern Joggers. A pleasant undulating off road run that starts in Welland. The BBQ and a pint in the village hall is a must after this race.

If both of those races don’t take your fancy then try the fast and furious 5km race on the cycle track in Stourport on the 20th. This is a speedy 3 lap race so it’s great for spectators.

We end June at Worcestershire County Cricket Ground for our Summer Charity Ball. Tickets are priced £20. See Gavin to get hold of these.

As more Monday night runs are now off road, I would like to remind you all to close the gates when the last one is through. As sheep are not allowed to be members of the club !

Enjoy your month and I hope to see you out on the road running or partying at the Ball. I would like to end by letting you know that your membership is due, so please pay April as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Mike
