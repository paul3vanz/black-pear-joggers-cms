What a busy month for BPJ, and well done Stuart!

It’s been great to see so many Black Pear Joggers out and about running this month. Over 40 people took part in the [Snowdon Marathon](https://bpj.org.uk/black-pears-celebrate-stuart-wilds-entry-to-the-100-marathon-club/ "Black Pears celebrate Stuart Wild’s entry to the 100 Marathon Club") where Stuart Wild became the first member of the club to run 100 marathons. A large number of first timers and more experienced runners took part in the Cardiff and Birmingham half marathons too.

Julie Gerrard picked up a prize in the Beacon Race, in which a handful of other members took part also, in torrential rain over the Malverns. The men’s cross country team came 8th out of 16 in their first ever [Gloucester League](https://bpj.org.uk/nice-start-for-the-black-pear-joggers-at-gloucester-cross-country-league/ "Nice Start for Black Pear Joggers at Gloucester Cross Country League") race. It would be great to see a women’s team in this event too… anyone up for it??!

Looking forward to November the club will be running its very own race, The [Croome Capability Canter](https://bpj.org.uk/croome-race/ "Croome Capability Canter"), for the third time. Thanks very much to [Actons Opticians](http://www.actonsopticians.co.uk/) who are sponsoring this year’s race. The race is almost full and so we need as many volunteers to help marshal this event as possible. We also need a group of people to run the water station. Please email [myself](mailto:chair@blackpearjoggers.org.uk) or [April](mailto:membership@blackpearjoggers.org.uk) if you are willing to help.

The numbers of members at the club are still growing which demonstrates just how successful and popular we are! Our popularity however can sometimes result in rather large group sizes and we need to ensure that they remain at a manageable size. As the winter, dark nights draw in I would also like to recommend to members the use of reflective clothing whilst out and about to increase your visibility to traffic. Please listen and support your group leaders and then we can continue to enjoy and be safe during our runs.

All the best for November,

Mr Lane
