Now in its 3rd year, this scenic, undulating 6.5 mile off-road race around the beautiful [Croome Park](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/croome/) saw 240 runners from 21 different clubs in attendance with great atmosphere on the day. The weather was cold but sunny, with course conditions extremely tough and muddy from the heavy rain over the previous days.

These were all excellent times given the extremely challenging course and conditions.

Julia Williams, director of [Premier Places](http://www.premierplaces.co.uk/) in Worcester (one our our race sponsors) along with Stuart Wild from the Black Pear Joggers gave out the prizes for runners. All winners received a pair of running sunglasses sponsored by [Actons Opticians](http://www.actonsopticians.co.uk/) in Worcester Cornmarket, and a voucher for [Runaround Sports](http://www.runaroundsports.co.uk/) in Worcester, as well as free entry for a year to [Croome National Trust](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/croome/). All finishers received a medal and goodie bag, which had lots of nice treats that went down extremely well with the runners.

A big shout out to the [Malvern Joggers](http://www.malvernjoggers.co.uk/) who have always really supported the race, with a record 47 runners this year. Thank you to all the fantastic people who volunteered to make the race a success, especially race secretary April Turner, who did a fantastic job organising the event.
