This was the clubs second fixture in the cross country league, again the club gave a good showing against a field that was a lot stronger compared to the [first fixture](https://bpj.org.uk/nice-start-for-the-black-pear-joggers-at-gloucester-cross-country-league/ "Nice Start for Black Pear Joggers at Gloucester Cross Country League"). The men's team was able to field 9 runners in the senior event.

The men's team came 9th overall out of 24 teams and the vets men's team coming 13th out of 22 team. As a team we have beaten Droitwich AC (14th) and Malvern Joggers (21st) so local bragging rights go to Team BPJ.

Unfortunately we could only field 1 member in the ladies race (Lorraine Westcott) but I feel she will now spread the word to what a good team event the cross country league is. And I look forward to more ladies joining in. Remember only 3 ladies are required to make a team.

The course was a lot flatter than the first fixture over in the Cotswolds, but conditions under foot were very slippery owing to some very muddy sections on the course and not forgetting the water jump (stream) that had to be negotiated three times. But even though conditions were challenging again Black Pears rose to the challenge with some fine displays.

Darren Salisbury came 12th overall and 1st in his age category, followed by two very good debuts from Bart Thomas 22nd overall and Matt Fitzgerald 71st overall.

The men’s team consists of the first six to cross the line but we want as many people as we can get as most teams were putting out up to three teams.

The ladies team only require three ladies, so I’m sure we could easily put out three teams as we have some good quality ladies at our club.
