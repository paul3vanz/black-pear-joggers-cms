![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/BPJMovembersLogo.png "Black Pear Movembers")It's Movember and time to make a difference.

Movember is an annual event throughout the month of November, which aims to raise vital awareness and funds for men's health including prostate and testicular cancer.

Three Black Pear Joggers (Lee Brighton, Steve Jones and Paul Evans) are taking part, with the commitment to grow a moustache for the month of November.

Please support their personal journey by making a donation. The size of which isn't important, every little contribution helps Movember to continue its funding of world class programmes.Â  If you want to know more about what you'll be helping to fund, you can visit Movember's [Program Overview](http://uk.movember.com/?home) page.

To highlight the importance of what they are doing, take a look at these statistics:

- 1 in 9 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime
- This year 40,000 new cases of the disease will be diagnosed in the UK
- 47% of testicular cancer cases occur in men under 35 years and over 90% occur in men under 55 years

If you'd like to help change these statistics, please make a [donation online](http://uk.movember.com/team/515389).

Thank you in advance for supporting their efforts to change the face of men's health.

The team will be keeping photo logs on their [Mo Spaces](http://uk.movember.com/team/515389) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/6389738308/).
