This evening Cat Sales and Lee Brighton will be collecting money for the Adidas Thunder Run (£31) and Conti Lightning Run (£33).

They will be there from 6:30pm and for a short while in the bar afterwards. They acknowledge that that is a fair amount of money in one go so they will be prioritising the Thunder Run entries this week, and will be looking to put the entries for the Lightning Run in at the start of December.

The demand for the Lightning run is less, so they are comfortable that that will be ok and give you all a a little while longer to pay.

If you are interested in joining the team, get in touch with Lee or Cat at the club or on the [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/6389738308/) group page.
