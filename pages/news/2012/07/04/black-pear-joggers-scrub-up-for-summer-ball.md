The Black Pear Joggers summer ball was a huge success. With a pig roast, DJ sets, rocking live music from 'Breach of the Peace', lots of dancing (including a conga line!) , everyone looked like they were having great fun.

With a dress code of 'black ties and posh frocks', everyone scrubbed up a treat, especially when usually seeing each other all sweaty, dressed in fluorescent running gear.

The ball raised aroundÂ£1,000 for [St. Richard's Hospice](http://www.strichards.org.uk/) through charity auctions and collections, with some great prizes. Thank you to all the businesses and individuals who donated prizes to the auction.

Also, a big thanks to the club's social secretary Gavin Paskin, who did a fantastic job of organising the ball. The ball marks the end of Gavin's tenure as social secretary. He will be stepping down after over 3 years of doing a great job organising social events for the club.

Bring on the Christmas party!
