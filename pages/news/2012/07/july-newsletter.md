Saturday the 30th June, [black tie do](https://bpj.org.uk/black-pear-joggers-scrub-up-for-summer-ball/ "Black Pear Joggers Scrub Up for Summer Ball") at Worcester CCC has to be one of the best nights out with BPJ I have had for some time and it was a fitting way to say thanks to Gavin for all his hard work over the past few years.  He has now been replaced by a social committee who will have a hard act to follow, GOOD LUCK!!!

Last month was a busy one with a lot of local races so well done to Bart who came first at the [Malvern Joggers 10k](https://bpj.org.uk/events/malvern-joggers-10k/?instance_id= "Malvern Joggers 10k") and to Darren with second place at the 5k in Stourport.

This month I hope to see the club represented at [Timberhonger 10k](http://www.timberhonger10k.co.uk/ "Timberhonger 10k") (Bromsgrove) and [Evesham 10k](https://bpj.org.uk/events/evesham-vale-10k/?instance_id= "Evesham Vale 10k") which both take place the weekend of 7/8 July. Also there is a mid-week 10k at Droitwich 11th July and [Pitchcroft 10k](http://www.worcester-ac.co.uk/FixturesRoadandXC.htm "Pitchcroft 10k and Fun Run") the 15th July.  It’s a shame that they are like buses and come all at once!  But good luck if you’re planning on running in them.

April the [Membership](https://bpj.org.uk/membership/ "Membership") secretary is still waiting for a lot of people to pay their yearly subscription.  If you are among this large group and don’t want your name to go on the notice board then please pay.

New kit has arrived and is available to [buy off the website](https://bpj.org.uk/kit/ "Kit") or please see Eleanor Wise for more details.

I have been asked by the landlady of the Mug House to remind runners to please park their cars on a Thursday night on School Bank road rather than filling up spaces on Cornmeadow Road by the pub. They feel that they may be losing out on passing trade as there is no close parking to the pub.

I hope you all have a good July and that the weather picks up at some stage.
