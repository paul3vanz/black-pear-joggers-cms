Tonights Magic Mile session went down with all that attended.

BPJ member, Nichola Robinson organised a one mile timed run from Pitchcroft as part of the [Marathon Talk Magic Mile Global Team Challenge 2012](http://www.marathontalk.com/challenges/magic_mile.php?action=details), giving people the chance to see how fast they can run a mile.

Everyone predicted how fast they would complete it, with the closest predicted time and a prize of a bag of monkey sweets going to Jemima!Â  Well done to everyone!

The times were as follows:

There has been talk of repeating the event for those that missed out and for attempts to improve their times. Watch this space...
