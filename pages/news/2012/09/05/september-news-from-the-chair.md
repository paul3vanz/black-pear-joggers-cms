As we head into September and the running groups head back onto the road, it is time to ask all members to remember to listen to their group leaders and muster when asked. Over the past few years the size of the groups has grown. I would ask that all groups with more than 15 people split into two smaller groups, which run with a two minute gap between each other. I hope that members take this chance to help each other and the club on this task.

Thank you to all group leaders, you are doing to a great job. I would like to remind you to endeavour to maintain the speed and pace agreed at the start. Please don’t leave anyone behind!

The next time there is food in the bar will be after our AGM. All members and non-members are welcome. The time is 8.15 on Monday the 24th.

The club this winter are entering cross-country teams in the Gloucester League. All members are welcome to run in these races with the first six men and four women counting as a team. I believe that there is a small cost of £3 per race. Chris Harris is going to be the club XC Director for the club. All races are run on a Saturday afternoon with the first one of four taking place at the Cotswold Farm Park – 6th October.

If you’re looking for a race this month – travel to sunny Droitwich on the 16th for their first Droitwich Salt Fest 9. This race takes in the surrounding countryside and makes use of the canal footpaths. This 9 mile, multi-terrain race starts and finishes in Vines Park.

Enjoy your running

Mike
