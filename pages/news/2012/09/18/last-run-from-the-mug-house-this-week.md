[![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/mughouse.jpg "Mug House")](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/mughouse.jpg)This week marks the last Thursday run from the [Mug House](http://www.clainesfriends.org.uk/mughouse.html) at Claines.

Meet outside the Claines church (postcode [WR3 7RN](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=WR3+7RN&hl=en&sll=52.8382,-2.327815&sspn=10.214208,28.54248&t=h&hnear=Claines+WR3+7RN,+United+Kingdom&z=16)) at the slightly earlier time of 6:45pm. Graham will start off at 7:00pm prompt, so everyone should be back before it is dark.

The scenic 5 mile off-road route along the old Salwarpe Canal & tracks of north Worcester at various speeds for all abilities.

After the run, why not join us and have a well deserved drink in the Mug's beer garden? All are welcome.
