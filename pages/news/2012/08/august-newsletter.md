Dear All,

The summer is moving fast and it would be great to say that all members have paid their subs for the year. Sadly there are still large numbers of runners who have failed to pay their £12. Unfortunately failure to pay leaves members uninsured and puts the club into a difficult position if an accident was to happen. To avoid having your name displayed please ensure that you have paid by the middle of this month. Thanks to all members who have renewed their membership and are enjoying the benefits.

On a more positive note it was great to see so many runners at Croome Park. I hope that you enjoyed the evening as much as myself. We now have now obtained our race licence to hold the Croome Capability Canter on the 18th November. More details will follow soon.

The club website is offering free advertising space to all paying members with a business or a service. This could take the form of an advert or a link to your own website. The Black Pear trade page is hoping to support member’s businesses and in return these services can look after the members too. Please send information to the webmaster Paul Evans.

The club’s AGM is on Monday 24th September and any nominations for the committee are to be sent to Helen Stanley before 2nd September.

For our next social event we are off to Worcester Beer Festival on Friday night (17 th). For those members who don’t like beer there is also a great collection of wine and cider. For those of you that don’t drink there is also live music!! I believe that it is £7 after 5pm.

Enjoy the next four weeks of running.

Mike Lane
