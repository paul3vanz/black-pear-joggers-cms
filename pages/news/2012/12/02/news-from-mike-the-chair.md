Hello BPJ

What a busy November the club has had. After our [second cross country](https://bpj.org.uk/another-good-result-for-bpjs-at-the-gloucester-cross-country-league/ "Another good result for BPJs at the Gloucester Cross Country League") venture we were placed ninth out of twenty four teams. The team and other joggers had an impromptu night out on the town after watching fireworks on the racecourse. I believe the next night out will follow the next cross country fixture on the 8th December. We are still looking for more runners to run this event, both men and women.

If you would like to give this a go please contact [Chris](https://bpj.org.uk/take-part-in-the-gloucestershire-cross-country-league-this-winter/ "Take Part in the Gloucestershire Cross Country League this Winter") or myself. If not it would be great to see a few of you for drinks that evening. Time and place to follow!

A couple of weekends after the cross country, BPJ put on its third [Croome Park Capability Canter](https://bpj.org.uk/croome-race/ "Croome Capability Canter"). I would like to thank all of those members who marshalled and helped out on the day. I would like to give special thanks to April who did a wonderful job organising the administration of this event. Also, Paul's support was crucial in organising speedy online payments. The event was fully subscribed again and 241 runners took part in what was a very wet and soggy day underfoot. It was also good for the club to see Bart winning in style! We have had lots of positive feedback about this event from a number of runners far and wide.

A number of members seem to have a passion for muddy runs which was demonstrated the other week with a number of runners completing the Suicide 6. Well done to all. It's also good to see so many BPJs regularly turning up on a Saturday morning to enjoy the [parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/worcester/), Worcester's free weekly timed 5km run.

As the nights are getting darker, as a committee we would like to ask members to ditch the iPods and don their reflective wear! The club will only function with volunteers, so it was pleasing to see new faces happy to lead running groups last Monday night. More leaders, smaller groups, more choice of pace and different routes, so please feel free to volunteer to become a group leader.

Christmas party tickets, for 12th January, are selling fast so make sure that you [book online](https://bpj.org.uk/featured-item/bpj-christmas-party-2012/ "BPJ Christmas Party 2012") or at the club on a Monday night. Fancy dress is optional but for those who would like to the theme is the letter 'M'!

Enjoy eating and drinking over the Christmas Season.

Happy Christmas and New Year from myself and the committee.

Mike
