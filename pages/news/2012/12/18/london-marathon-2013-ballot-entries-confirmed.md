The ballot has been drawn and the lucky people who have places for the 2013 [Virgin London Marathon](http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com) are:

- Chris Bomber Harris
- Clive Andrews
- Dave Shacklock
- Stuart Brown

Black Pear Joggers receive a certain amount of places for the marathon because of our affiliation with UK Athletics ([read more](http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/marathon-centre/enter-virgin-london-marathon/uk-athletics-club-entries/)). To be eligible for the club ballot, entrants must have been a paid-up member for at least 1 year and have been rejected from the normal ballot.

The London Marathon is the world's largest marathon, with a colossal 36,748 finishing in 2012.

Congratulations to you all and best of luck with your training!
