![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wilf-bates-225x300.jpg "Wilf Bates")Wilf is starting  the group A Brisk Walk, it consists of about 2.5 to 3 miles for those who would like to get in to running but don't feel fit enough to join the jog/walk group. (He is hoping to start this on 18th June,if there is enough interest). This group would be perfect for those who would like to do some moderate exercise, in a sociable atmosphere. Meeting times are the same as all the other groups, 6.50pm Monday nights at Perdiswell.
