This is a route done most club nights as efforts allowing anyone the chance to run faster and then double back to the rear of the group as they wish, while slower runners take their time.

The route typically leaves the leisure centre and turns right onto Bilford Rd to the bottom and then turns right onto A38 Droitwich road. They continue along the A38 under the bridge to the main A449 and up into Fernhill Heath before turning right again into Hurst Lane A4536. Continuing on onto Blackpole Road and into Blackpole the route then loop back right again under the railway bridge onto Bilford Rd to return to Perdiswell Leisure Centre.
