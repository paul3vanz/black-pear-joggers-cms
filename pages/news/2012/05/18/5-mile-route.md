A typical 5 mile route would leave the leisure centre and turn left onto Bilford Rd and then continue onto Astwood Rd, before joining Rainbow Hill and heading towards the city centre. The route now heads down Lowesmoor before turning left along A38 City Walls Rd and into Sidbury

and then onto the canal where it follows the canal all the way back to the lock opposite the Leisure Centre.
