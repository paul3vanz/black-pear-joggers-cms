Have you been keeping an eye on your race and parkrun times to work towards a [club standards award](https://bpj.org.uk/club-standards/)?

With spring marathons being run, a few 10Ks, half marathons and four months of parkruns, we now have **180** BPJs that have completed at least one event that would count towards an award, some only one event short of an award and now **27** members that have earned themselves an award.

The awards are a great way to set yourself targets and goals for your running. By completing at least three different events (from 1 Mile, 5K, 10K, Half Marathon, Marathon) at the particular standard for your age/gender category, you can earn one of four awards (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum). Find out more on the [club standards](https://bpj.org.uk/club-standards/) page.

I'm pleased to announce the following that have earned an award:

- Christopher Berry - Silver
- David Bessant - Bronze
- Julie Bott - Bronze

If your name is on the list, we will print off your shiny certificate and be in touch soon to arrange to present you with it. You can review your race results through the club website, on the [race results](https://bpj.org.uk/records-and-rankings/race-results/) page or via the [Power of 10](http://www.powerof10.info/) site.

Once you've earned an award, you can then work toward the next level.

If you have any questions, please feel free to [get in touch](https://bpj.org.uk/contact-the-club/) or discuss on the [club Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/blackpearjoggers/).

A big thank you to Derek Jackson who put together the awards scheme for the club to run.
