> It was the first race of the Cross Country season on Saturday and as was the case last year, the conditions were hot and dry underfoot. The venue was Crypt School, Blackbridge, Gloucester, a location that has been used quite a few times to host both the Gloucestershire League and Birmingham League fixtures.

> It’s always more fun when men and women race at the same venue and despite the Beacon race and Birmingham full and half Marathons taking place that weekend, we had a good turnout of runners and Supporters. Many runners joined the team for the first time: **Amy Stewart, Dominique Edwards, Donna Rushton, Rachel Booth, Jane Fairlamb** and **Richard Cranswick** and hopefully they’ll be back!
> 
> As usual the ladies raced first and 173 ladies, and for the first time over 65 men, took on the 3.75 miles course which included 2 small laps and 2 large laps round the field, through the wooded area and around the running track. The course was very firm and not too hilly, which accounted for some fast times. First back for the Ladies Team was **Victoria Watkins** in 37th position overall, followed by **Lucie White** and **Annie Bird** making up our “A” team (9th overall). **Jemima Lowe, Dominique Edwards** and **Nichola Robinson** made up the “B” team (19th overall), **Jane Fairlamb, Donna Rushton** and **Rebecca Terry** were the “C” team (26th overall) and **Amy Stewart, Rachel Booth** and **Cat Kell**y our “D” team (34th overall). We also fielded 3 Masters Teams (over 35 runners) who were 5th, 14th and 20th.
> 
> Next up were the men who raced approximately 5.7 miles around the same course. 205 men took part in the Senior mens race, which included 2 medium laps and 3 large laps. The mens race is always engaging for spectators as because of the extra laps, there is always someone to cheer from each direction. First back for Black Pear Joggers was **Ian Wild** in 44th position, next was **Richard Cranswick** in 74th position, **Chris Attwood** in 80th position, **Matt Moon** in 107th position and **Anthony Jones** in 175th. Unfortunately, we were 1 short of a full team for the open category, as the men require 6 runners, but our Masters team (over 40 runners) finished 8th.

> This was a very encouraging start to the Season and as the conditions get colder and muddier, the training benefits get even better (when you’re 20 miles into your Spring marathon you’ll remember the determination
