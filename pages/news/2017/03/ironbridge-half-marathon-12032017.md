Once again I must apologise because in the excitement of my recent raucous hen weekend, I totally forgot to post this race report contribution from **Claire Shacklock**. Thanks **Claire**. The actual runner's take on races really help others decide if these events are worth entering.

> Well, I have hated half marathons for the last 3 years, since March 2014 when I got my last PB. Really struggled with them, so deciding to do a half 3 days ago must of helped![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/elevation.png), although I didn't sleep much last night. At the start I got talking to **Sarah Morris** and her mum and realised there was a huge hill, about 8 miles and 2 bridges to go over! (I hate bridges and hills)  Also I noticed that a few local runners had trail shoes on!! I had my week old brand new white trainers on!!!![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ironbridge-half.jpg) There was no worry of what to wear after yesterday’s weather, so I did my usual trick of going to the toilet too late, so I started from the back (it was chipped). The route started on the Telford 10k route, which was narrow. It was quite hard to get round people but I tried my hardest. About 6 miles in the ground changed to more of a trail path but wasn't too bad, until 'the hill' at 8! OMG, it was tough, then at miles 10-11 the mud was terrible!! You had to walk or slip over so my poor white trainers are no more :(  the 2nd half of the race was mostly uphill (or so it felt), but I managed to pick my pace back up and bagged myself a PB ! It’s a great race. I would definitely recommend it, just don't wear new trainers! For £18 you get a medal, t-shirt and goodie bag with lots of food and the route was lovely through small villages and countryside. Other BPJ's who took part in the race were **Matt Davis**, **Nick Hooper** and **Scott Collinson**.
