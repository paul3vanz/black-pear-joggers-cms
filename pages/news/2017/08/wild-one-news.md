A few of you may know that we have some budding brewers in our jogging midst. Four BPJ's have started Worcester based **Loyal City Brewing Company** and, in the spirit (every pun intended) of Stuart Wild's passion for alcohol and in honour of Wild One's fifth anniversary, we are working with the guys to come up with our very own, limited edition Craft Ale. The generous 500ml bottles will then be given away as prizes both at Wild One and Croome in November and, if it proves popular, we will look to sell it as a promotional item with all proceeds going to our nominated charities.

This is where **YOU** come in. We would like club members to provide name suggestions via the following survey link by **Sunday September 3rd.** The winning suggestion will be announced at the club run on Monday evening and will also receive a bottle of this personalised beverage on the day.

To mark the occasion still further we also have a very special anniversary medal courtesy of Ian Wild and his partner Lucie's daughter Molly. All the more reason to enter, know that your money is going to two great causes (![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/091916_1039_2016SportsA11.png) Day Centre and Worcester Young Carers![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/091916_1039_2016SportsA12.png)) and bagsy yourselves some exclusive bling.

There is no on the day entry but you haven't missed the deadline yet so get your applications in. Don't forget that pairs can now run together and also do a different number of laps. Thus one of you could do 8 laps and one could do 2 as long as between you the full 10 laps have been run.

So, for more information about the event, see the dedicated [webpage](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/wild-race/), download a form from the website ([Application form link](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Wild-One-2017-Entry-Form.pdf)) and don't forget that laps this year are back to 2.62 miles and the venue is the Old Elizabethans Cricket Club, The Memorial Ground, Perdiswell Park, Droitwich Road, Worcester WR3 7SN. [OESCC website](http://www.oescricket.co.uk/) ![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wsb_431x279_pavpiccie-e1504001391907.jpg)![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/OEsgroundaug07c-795x530.jpg)![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Old-elizabethan-map-795x340.png)
