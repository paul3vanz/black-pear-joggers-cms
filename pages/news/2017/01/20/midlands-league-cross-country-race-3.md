Not only did **Lorraine** scribe the race report this week, she also supplied photos of her choice to go with it, making my life much easier. Thank you again Lorraine, not only for the great job you do penning these each time, but for the sterling effort you and Bomber put in organising everybody for these events.

We travelled to Aldersley Stadium, Wolverhampton for the race, a venue we have raced at a few times before. This time however, it was ladies only event, all three Mens Birmingham League divisions were racing elsewhere. This meant that the Midlands League (Divisions 1 and 2) had to supply all their own race officials. We were very grateful to have **Hazel Sherrington** volunteering as Funnel Steward, on behalf of the club, thanks also to **Claire Shacklock** and **Anthony Jones**, for their support and photography.

> Although a little bit down on numbers, compared to other races, we still managed to field two teams for the 3.7 miles Cross Country race. The course was a varied one. We started at the bottom of a slight hill and then had to run 1 small lap and 2 big ![Rebecca Wolvo](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rebecca-Wolvo-533x800.jpg)laps![Lorraine Wolvo](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Lorraine-Wolvo-533x800.jpg). We all admitted that for quite a lot of the race, we weren’t entirely sure where we were! We went from one field to another and back again, through wooded bits and past the tennis courts. Although it had been frosty, the mud was surprisingly wet and sticky and as usual leg sapping but we were all smiling when we crossed the finish line.

Next was **Katie Downing** in 30.04 and 69th, **Rebecca Terry** came in at 31.22 and 97th, **Lorraine Griffiths** in 31.34 and 104th. **Simone Melia** was next to finish in 33.05 and 126th, **Jade Scott-Walker** in 33.53 and 143rd, **Wendy Cole** in 35.48 and 164th and **Catherine Kelly** in 38.25 and 192nd. The team was 14th overall out of 25 teams and our Masters Team was 6th out of 22 teams. So once again, some good results for the ![Cat Wolvo](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cat-Wolvo-533x800.jpg)club.![wendy](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wendy-533x800.jpg)

> We only have 2 races left this Season, the next one is once again for the Midlands League at Warwick University on 11th February and the final race is for the Gloucestershire League on 18th February at Pittville Park, Cheltenham. With quite a lot of us now Marathon training, I think we’re all feeling grateful for the strength that the Cross Country has given us both mentally and physically. To reward ourselves for our efforts over the Season, we’re also planning on going for Afternoon tea after the final race.

> Whilst we were busy in Wolverhampton, the men were racing in the Birmingham League at Droitwich. It was a very important race for them and although I wasn’t there, the results speak for themselves. BPJ men had 5 runners in the top 5 and they finished top team and are top of Division 3 after 3 races, with only 1 to go. Promotion to Division 2 is pretty much guaranteed and they stand a good chance of finishing top of the Division. There final race is again at Droitwich on 11th February and it will be hosted by the club. If you want to race or can help out by volunteering, please contact **Chris Harris** or **Paul Evans**.
