Some recent [club records](https://bpj.org.uk/records-and-rankings/club-records/) have been quietly taken over the winter period. Well done Sarah, Toby and Avril...

**Sarah Kellett** ventured up to Poole parkrun on Christmas Eve to smash out a 20:25 parkrun PB, claiming the club's FV35 record.

**Toby Whitfield** now in the U23 category added the marathon (3:29:29), 10K (37:27) and parkrun (18:30) records to his collection over the winter. Toby now has a whopping 8 club records to his name across the U20 and U23 categories, with just the half marathon and 20M records yet to claim!

**Avril Munday**, one of the club's regular group leaders and former club treasurer took the FV60 parkrun top spot with a 26:04 at Worcester parkrun in early December, increasing her tally of records to 4.
