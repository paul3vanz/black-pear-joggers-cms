## MAGIC MILE

The next magic mile events will take place in a couple of weeks. Your chance to see how fast you can run a single mile. 68 took part in the May events, many were surprised at just how quick they ran. Follow the links below to find out more:

- [Monday 17th July](https://www.facebook.com/events/1790640434579523/) (Pitchcroft Grandstand at 7:30pm)
- [Tuesday 18th July](https://www.facebook.com/events/1947732365510917/) (Diglis Bridge at 7:15pm)
- [Saturday 22nd July](https://www.facebook.com/events/137399016843001/) (Diglis Bridge at 10:30am)

## THE WILD ONE

Organisation for the club's Wild One charity race is in full swing led by race director Claire. Due to clashes with local races, we've moved it to the 10th September and it's back by Perdiswell and back to 10 laps, rather than 20; starting and finishing at Old Elizabethans Cricket Club (with a bar and bouncy castle). This year’s (optional) fancy dress theme is "music" e.g. pop stars, bands and rock icons. This year, runners in pairs are free to run at the same time rather than alternating laps. This is a great way you can support your running partner.

Entries are now open, so either get booked on solo or get recruiting the rest of your team and planning your outfits. [Find out more about the Wild One](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/wild-race/).

## CROOME CAPABILITY CANTER

This year's [Croome race](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/croome-race/) will be on Sunday 26th November, starting half an hour earlier than usual; 9am. Entries will open on Monday 9th October 2017 at 9pm (pm = evening, not morning!). Last year sold out in less than two minutes, so be ready to avoid disappointment.

The practice run a couple of weeks ago was attended by 90 runners including BPJs and our chums from Malvern and Pershore. The collection bucket raised £71.40 that will go to the National Trust. Some were greeted by a surprise sighting of the male [Warwick Rowers](https://www.facebook.com/warwickrowers/) in the middle of their naked calendar photoshoot!

## COUCH TO 5K AND 5-10K PROGRAMMES

Next Monday evening will see the runners from the Couch to 5K and 5-10K programmes take their 'graduation race'. We need marshals to cheer them round a 5K/10K route starting and finishing at Perdiswell, so if you can spare some time, please get in touch with Claire, Jo or myself. They have all done fantastic and it would be great if we could cheer them on. A big thanks to Jo, Claire, Tracy, Richard, Gay, Wendy, Alison and Becky for leading them over the last few months.

The next programmes will start some time in September, after the summer holidays. Dates will be advertised once confirmed, so please start recruiting any friends/colleagues/relatives that may be interested. The jog/walk groups will continue to be on offer in the meantime as a starting point for new members with some running experience.

## COMMITTEE ROLES

Due to work commitments, James has had to step down as club treasurer. Faced with a difficult task of taking over the accounts mid-year was never going to be easy and I'm grateful for the time he has spent on trying to sort this. I have now migrated the accounts to a modern online bookkeeping tool, which makes it much easier to keep on top of. I'm very grateful for the help of Jenni Morris who has reviewed the system, provided guidance and audited and signed off the previous year's accounts, so we're now back on track! If you are interested in taking on this role, please get in touch and I can send the role description and answer any questions you have. The role will be up for election at the AGM in November. In the meantime, Hazel Sherrington has kindly stepped up and has taken on the role of treasurer.

Mike is also no longer able to continue the social secretary role due to work and family commitments. We've taken the decision not to retain this as a separate role going forward. Instead, the club's social calendar will include things like:

- The Christmas party
- Picnics and meals after Phil's new travelling Sunday runs
- Social events by members for marathon place charity fundraising meals
- More chip nights

We'd like to encourage members to step up and help organise social events. It can be as simple as picking a date and location to go out drinking, a meal out or something more elaborate. If you would like any guidance or help promoting an event, let us know.

## PITCHCROFT PARKRUN

The [Pitchcroft parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/worcesterpitchcroft/) has finally arrived. A big well done to Sam and the team of volunteers. The club can also be proud to have voted to donate a third (£1000) of the setup costs, the rest of which came from the City Council and H&W Sports Partnership. It's another great addition to Worcester's running community. Having ran it myself on the inaugural event, I can say it's most definitely a fast, PB-potential course. The event has also helped to relieve some of the congestion at the [Worcester parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/worcester/) at the Countryside centre, which is now seeing around 200 less runners each week.

## COMMITTEE MEETING

Our next committee meeting is next Monday (10th July). If you have any important issues you'd like to raise, please get in touch.
