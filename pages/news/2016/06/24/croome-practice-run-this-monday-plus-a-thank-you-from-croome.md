This Monday (27th June 2016) we will be running our summer practice run at [Croome Park](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/croome/) instead of Perdiswell. This gives the chance for all the club members that help at the Croome Race in November to be able to enjoy the scenic route.

There is a suggested donation of £1 for all that attend, to help support the National Trust maintain Croome, so that we can continue to run here.

The run will start at 7pm prompt, please arrive no later than 6:45pm so you can hear the pre-run briefing (we don’t want you to end up being lost in the grounds!). There should be a range of paces on offer, although some of the slower pace groups may not run the full 6.5 miles due to time.

Please try to car share where possible as parking is limited.

We will also be going to the pub after for drinks at the [Rose and Crown](http://rosecrownworcesterpub.co.uk/) in Severn Stoke (postcode WR8 9JA).

The next [Croome Capability Canter](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/croome-race/) race will be on **Sunday, 27th November 2016**.

> Thank you so much for the amazing cheque from the Black Pear Joggers to Croome. We have purchased a new Chainsaw with some of the money, which is being used by the ranger team out in parkland already. I hope to use the rest of the money to install new accessible gates in the parkland to replace stiles so that more people can get out and about in the parkland at Croome. Thanks to all participants and organisers of the Capability Canter for their generosity!
