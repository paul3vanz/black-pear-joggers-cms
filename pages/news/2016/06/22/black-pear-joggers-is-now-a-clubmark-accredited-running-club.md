I am delighted to say that after 9 months of work...

The Black Pear Joggers are officially a Clubmark accredited running club and we get our certificate on Saturday.

This means that England Athletics recognise that we are a safe, inclusive, quality running club and that we have met all of the criteria set out for adult running clubs. This process has certainly been a challenge at times, but it is definitely something that has helped our running club to continue to develop.

Find out more about the benefits of Clubmark on our [Clubmark page](https://bpj.org.uk/clubmark/).
