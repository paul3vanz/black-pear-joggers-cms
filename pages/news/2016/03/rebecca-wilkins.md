Dear Club Members and Friends,

It is with great sadness that I am writing this post for the clubs website. Some of you may be aware of the upsetting news of Rebecca Wilkins’ death last weekend.

Rebecca has been a club member for many years and has always given 100% in races and training. Over the last few weeks she has been involved in the couch to 5k coaching classes giving advice to new runners. She had many good friends within the Black Pear Joggers and will be missed. I will personally miss hearing about her crazy DIY stories.

If you would like to pay your respects to Rebecca the funeral will be taking place at 11.30am on Monday 21st March at Worcester Crematorium, Astwood Cemetery, Tintern Avenue, Worcester. WR3 8HA

Yours sincerely

Mike Lane
