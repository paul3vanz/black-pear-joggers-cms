Following the [sad news about Rebecca Wilkins](https://bpj.org.uk/2016/03/rebecca-wilkins/), Lesley Harris is arranging a walk from the Mug Inn (Claines) this Saturday (5th March) in memory of Becky.

It's really short notice but Saturday would have been Becky's Birthday.

If you would like to take part in this, meet at 4pm at the Mug, from there the walk will follow the 5 mile Mug Run route and then back to the Mug Inn for drinks.
