Hello to all my fellow BPJ’s,

Below are the details (as far as possible) for all of the 2016 Black Pear Jogger League races! As you can see, there are some months packed with races, some months not so, and even two races on one day in May! I try to keep them local, there are some that include a bit of travel but they’re included because I know they are well attended. This year there’s even a marathon!

I am making some important changes to try and level the playing field as far as possible to the league this year. 22 races are included but only points scored in your top 10 races will count. This concept means that some of the less participated runs (Pendock’s “back marker”, Kazzandra Bishop, in 2015 scored 14 points!) will be great opportunities to collect those extra points.

The scoring system 25 down to 1 will stay the same. However no longer will single 1 point participation points count.

I will also take this opportunity to make it clear, the cut-off date for league entry is firm and will not be changed. If membership renewal is not done in time, you will not be added at a later date and as such will not be included in the 2016 league. Please [renew on time](https://bpj.org.uk/membership/) to avoid disappointment.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. I’m not as bad as I look!

Good luck with your running in 2016, stay safe, avoid injury and most importantly, enjoy yourselves.

Your League Manager Ben Dillon

P.S. Have I mentioned [I’m running a marathon](http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/BenjaminDillon)?
