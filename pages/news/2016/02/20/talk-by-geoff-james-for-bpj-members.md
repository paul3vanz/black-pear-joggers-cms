On Monday 22nd February 2016 we are excited to present Geoff James coach from the Birchfield Harriers and our England Athletics Club Mentor who will be doing a talk for our members in the Lecture Theatre of the Riverside Building at Worcester University at 7.30pm. He also has another claim to fame....he coached our very own John Potts! The talk will be on running and the different energy systems and going onto Fartlek and the use of those systems. This talk will really be of benefit to people wanting to get faster, people who want to understand their body more and people who want to train smarter.

To accommodate this session and still get in a run. We will be running from the Riverside Building at 6.30pm that evening. Parking is available for Â£1 for the evening, or 2 hours are free at Homebase (please think carefully about whether you will go over the 2 hours with the run and the talk as you might need to buy a ticket).

If you are planning to attend please fill in the Survey accordingly so we know how many people we need to accommodate. If you are planning to run from Perdiswell as usual please also indicate on the survey so we can get an idea of the spread of groups etc.
