It is lovely when club members submit stories. It makes for interesting reading, providing greater diversity with both a different writing style and varied content. A long standing committee member and regular contributor to all things BPJ, **Kazz Bishop** has submitted this report about a little known event. You may well inspire others to participate in this one next year because of your superbly descriptive write up. Thank you for this contribution **Kazz**.

> ![sheepwalk](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sheepwalk.png)The pre-race pack asked participants to turn up at 10am for the warm-up.  It was a fun, family event, ![sheepwalk-shocker](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sheepwalk-shocker-651x800.jpg)hosting a 2k fun run and a 10k multi-terrain race.

> Starting in the grounds of the beautiful Enville Hall, we sauntered down the driveway and headed into the woods for a bit of muddy fun. That was before we hit the hills…. From the 2k mile marker to the 5k mile marker was a solid, unrelenting uphill climb through winding country lanes, all lined with curious watchful sheep (well, it IS called the Sheepwalk Shocker!)
> 
> I gasped with genuine delight as, upon reaching the summit of Sheepwalk Lane, the view was spectacular, looking down the whole length of Worcestershire, clear to the Malverns, basking in a sunny blue haze. It was truly breathtaking - and not purely down to the steep gradient we’d all puffed our way up.
> 
> A well-timed water stop provided refreshment at the halfway marker and from then on, things took a welcome downhill turn. A quick twist to take us halfway back up Sheepwalk Lane, then a terrific downhill sweep across the fields for the final 2k. The goody bag consisted of a fluorescent yellow tech t-shirt, a race-themed water bottle and bespoke medal. There was a choice of fruit at the finish, but some chocolate would have been welcome.
> 
> Lovely course, well organised and amazing support from the locals.  Definitely doing it again!
