Thank you Lorraine for this fantastic first cross country race report. If you haven't tried it, want a tough multi terrain challenge with some fun, barmy people, then get in touch with the lovely Lorraine Griffiths, ladies' team captain or Chris Bomber Harris, men's team captain.

> This Saturday was the first fixture of the 2016/2017 Cross Country season.  It was a Gloucestershire League race and at a new venue, Little Rissington, near the stunning Bourton on the Water.  We had a fantastic team turnout with 10 men and 14 ladies, with quite a few runners trying Cross Country for the first time.  Whilst it wasn’t even the slightest bit muddy, the feedback that I received (I was supporting due to the Great Birmingha![chris-attwood](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Chris-Attwood-533x800.jpg)m Run the next day) was that it was the hilliest, toughest Cross Country race anyone had ever experienced.  Whilst the setting was picturesque, there were 3 hills that had to be ran up twice, so within a 4 (ladies) or 6 (men) mile race, that is a significant amount of hills to contend with.  Our new Team members were therefore, quite literally thrown in at the deep end but they didn’t seem to mind.

> Black Pear Joggers take part in three Cross Country Leagues: Gloucestershire League (men & women), Birmingham League (men) and Midlands League (women).  This season the men and women are only competing together at the Gloucestershire League races and personally I’m going to miss the men cheering us on at the Midlands League (I’m sure they’ll miss us too).  The camaraderie amongst the teams is very motivating.  The next race is a Gloucestershire League one on 5th November, so we all get to run, cheer, drink tea, eat cake and generally have fun together one more time before we go off to our separate venues on 12th November.
