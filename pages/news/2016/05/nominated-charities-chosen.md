We are pleased to announce that after a vote, the chosen charities that the club will be supporting from 2016 are Worcester-based charities **Maggs Day Centre** and **Worcestershire Young Carers (YSS)**.

We hope to keep these as our nominated charities for at least the next couple of years to ensure we can raise some good money for them with events such as the [Wild One](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/wild-race/) race and other events like the Christmas party.

Maggs Day Centre, founded in 1984, is dedicated to helping the homeless people of Worcester and offers them a safe and warm place to go after a night sleeping rough on the street. Open five days a week, the day centre provides homeless people with a safe and warm place where they can use the toilet, take a shower and have a hot and healthy meal.
