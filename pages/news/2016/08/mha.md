Another acronym and no, MHA is not a new form of masters degree, but it is an honour bestowed on a number of the club members that you may well know nothing about, because thus far we have not really advertised it. Before I reveal all, let me give you a bit of the background… and yes this is a cheap trick to try to get you to read more of my write up. ![Smiley winky](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Smiley-winky.jpg)

We all know being active is fabulous for your physical health and fitness, but there is much publicity about how it can improve your mental wellbei![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/082716_1037_MHA3.jpg)ng. Anybody who remembers the lovely **Peter Duncan Gilbert**, former chairman and an incredibly eloquent advocate of running, will know how vocal he was on the subject.

I don’t profess to understand the science behind this, I just know from personal experience that it is the case and I am sure that a number of our members can testify to this ![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/082716_1037_MHA4.png)as well. Recognising this association and link, England Athletics launched a new Mental Health Ambassador programme supported by the charity [Mind](http://www.mind.org.uk/) back in April this year. Nationwide, 128 people have be![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/082716_1037_MHA2.png)en recruited, from 91 affiliated athletics clubs across the country. Black Pear Joggers are lucky to have 4, the most of **ANY** club and we are all keen to do a bit of running and talking. This volunteer programme links to [#runandtalk](https://twitter.com/hashtag/runandtalk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag), a twitter campaign to improve mental health through running in England.

**Okay, without further ado, let me introduce you to your BPJ Mental Health Ambassadors**

 ![Your MHA](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Your-MHA.png)

![Table of experience](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Table-of-experience.png)

**What does the role of MHA entail?**

This is our pledge to you:

"We are committed to our cause of improving mental well-being through running"

**How will we and can we do this?**

Through:

1. **Support![082716_1037_MHA9.jpg](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/082716_1037_MHA9.jpg)**

We will work with other people in the running club or group (such as committee members or group leaders) to proactively support the mental wellbeing of club/group members. This will entail providing information about local services that can offer support to participants with needs not related to sport.

2. **Engagement**

This will involve making links between the club/group and local mental health groups and organisations to encourage their members to start running.

3. **Sharing**

We will share England Athletics Facebook posts about #runandtalk and other related campaigns and content.![therapy](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/therapy.jpg)

4. **Talking**

Starting conversations about mental health with other club or group members.

5. **Being advocates**

Sharing guidance and information provided by England Athletics with elected club/group officials and others about mental health issues related to running.

6. **Volunteering**

By getting involved and actively participating in volunteer opportunities to support people experiencing mental health problems to start running.

- England Athletics’ ‘Athletics and Mental Health resource’s
- Access to Time to Change Champion e-learning modules
