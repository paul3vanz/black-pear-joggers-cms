And then there were 6. We are multiplying and giving you strength in numbers. We are delighted to welcome **Neil Richards** and **Alison Law** as additional, newly appointed Mental Health Ambassadors. As with the previous announcement, we want to introduce them properly so you will know who to approach and how to identify us should you wish to.

**Your new BPJ Mental Health Ambassadors:**

I have been a member of Black Pears Joggers for about 4 years. Since joining I have qualified as a Lirf leader and a guide runner. I also run the Wednesday HillsÂ club (always places available!).

I want to be a mental health ambassador as I have personal experience of depression and understand how running can be a tool to help people manage their depression.

**Alison![090916_1325_Twomoreanda3.jpg](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/090916_1325_Twomoreanda3.jpg)**

I have been with the Black Pears for about 5 months now and recently just become a LiRF. I have struggled all my life with mental health issues particularly anxiety and depression. My mum died when I was a teenager due to alcoholism and I found this very difficult to deal with. Subsequently this lead to my own alcohol, drug and mental health problems as a youngster. Thankfully over time I got through it and came out on the other side. I had my daughter when I was 26 and she was diagnosed with Autism and learning difficulties. This, combined with single parenthood, has provided me with another set of challenges, including carer status and an inability to work. I have therefore channelled my energies into support roles and MH volunteer work, groups to encourage running and self-improvement courses. Running has helped me so much. I love it and I love the feeling I get afterwards. I wanted to become a Mental Health Ambassador so that I can put my experience and qualifications to good use and help others. I'm a good listener, I'm kind and caring, positive and supportive.

This write up is also to announce our launch event which will take place on **Monday 10th October** at the usual time and place (Perdiswell Sports Ce![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/090916_1325_Twomoreanda7.jpg)ntre, 18.50) to support **World Mental Health Day**. We will be hosting runs of all different capabilities and will all be sporting identifying coloured t-shirts so you can easily see us. The idea is to encourage people to #**runandtalk** to improve their mental wellbeing through running and to break down the stig![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/090916_1325_Twomoreanda6.png)ma associated with mental health by getting people talking about it.  As Mental Health Ambassadors we want to be a driving force for this campaign and encourage new and existing runners within the club to take part. If you think you or anybody you know, whether an existing member or not, would benefit from the event, please share this and encourage them to join us.

**Chips and Chat** The event will be followed by 'chips and chat' at The![](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/090916_1325_Twomoreanda5.jpg) Blackpole Inn, Blackpole Road, Worcester, WR3 8SQ, which everyone is also invited to.

For any further information, please do not hesitate to contact any of your MHA directly.

**Steve, James, Bex, Tracy, Neil and Alison**
