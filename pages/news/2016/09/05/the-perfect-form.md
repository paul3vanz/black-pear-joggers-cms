### Running Technique![Running technique](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Running-technique.jpg)

**Claire** and **I** will be leading a new 8 week programme starting on Monday 19th September. This programme will be for a group of 10 runners initially who want to focus on improving their running technique through coached Monday sessions and homework. The 10 people in the group need to be people who are **NOT** training for half or full marathons as when working on technique it is likely that it will get worse before it gets better! So these sessions are most ideal for people without anything major planned in the next 8 weeks. It is also very important that you are injury free as other activities such as jumping will be involved! If more than 10 of you are interested in the sessions we shall pull names out of a hat.

Please express your interest via facebook or by email to **clubmark@bpj.org.uk** by **Monday 12th September**

**Jo Evans**
