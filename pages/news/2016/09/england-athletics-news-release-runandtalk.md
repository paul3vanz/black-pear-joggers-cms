To coincide with World Mental Health Day on Monday 10th October **Black Pear Joggers** are pleased to be supporting **#runandtalk,** an England Athletics ![090916_1325_Twomoreanda6.png](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/090916_1325_Twomoreanda6.png)initiative. The event aims to improve mental wellbeing through running and break down the stigma associated with mental health by getting people talking about it.

**#runandtal![090916_1325_Twomoreanda4.png](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/090916_1325_Twomoreanda4.png)k** takes place during the week of 8th-14th October 2016 with people signing up to run one mile or further and have a chat either with friends, family, colleagues or other runners at a time and location of their choice or by joining one of the organised runs at an England Athletics club or RunTogether group. The **#runandtalk** campaign aims to improve mental health through running in England by:

- getting people talking about mental health, sharing their experiences and removing stigma
- raising awareness of mental health problems
- supporting people experiencing mental health problems to be physically active through running whether that is to support them in starting, returning to or continuing to running

We’re often told that physical activity is good for our bodies and our minds, but having a mental health problem can make it difficult to get started, for a number of reasons, ranging from negative body image, or a lack of self-esteem through to practical reasons such as having no one to go with, or not knowing wh![mh-advert](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MH-advert-558x800.png)ere to get started.

**Black Pear Joggers** are organising a run on **10th October** at **6.50** from **Perdiswell Leisure Centre.** The run(s) will be various distances and will include options for walking, jogging and running so everyone is welcome whether you are new to running, looking to get back into it or a regular runner.

To register to join us on the run or for more information contact:

**Tracy Kennish, [publicity@blackpearjogger.org.uk](mailto:publicity@blackpearjogger.org.uk), 07789 276970**

The run(s) are supported by our volunteer England Athletics Mental Health Ambassador(s). Our friendly ambassadors **Steve, James, Bex, Tracy, Alison** and **Neil** have lived experience of mental health problems themselves or through close family or friends and are passionate about improving mental wellbeing through running.

Paul Evans, Club Chairman said:

> **“It’s great to see the club’s mental health ambassadors supporting the #runandtalk campaign. The club is proud to have members of all abilities and backgrounds, supporting each other from their first mile to their first marathon and beyond. Like an extended family, there is always someone to give you a much needed boost when you’re having a bad day.”**

Look at all these people... we can't all be wrong!

Join the conversation on social media using **#runandtalk.**

The #runandtalk campaign is being supported by the mental health charity Mind. Hayley Jarvis, Community Programmes Manager (Sport) at Mind, said:

> **“Mind is delighted to support England Athletics and the #runandtalk initiative. It’s well known that regular exercise is good for our bodies – and there’s good evidence that being active improves our mental wellbeing too. Mental health problems are more common than people think with one in four people experiencing one each year. #runandtalk is a great initiative that everyone can get involved with to support their own mental health, while meeting others in their local community.”**

The campaign is also partnering with GoodGym, a community of runners who use their runs for social good. Members stop off on runs to support isolated older people and undertake manual labour for community organisations. Runners have carried out thousands of runs to help older people in London and other cities across the UK. Throughout the initiative GoodGym will be hosting a series of starter sessions to get people running, talking and doing good in their local area. GoodGym founder Ivo Gormley said:

> **“Running makes you feel amazing, so does helping other people. Doing both at the same time is powerful way to feel great about who you are. You also meet other people at the same time. GoodGym is excited to be part of the #runandtalk campaign in support of World Mental Health Day. Running can be an amazing way to connect, whether that's with those who you're running with or those running to when supporting socially isolated older people."**

Liz Purbrick, National Disability Manager at England Athletics said:

> **“We are really pleased to be supporting World Mental Health Day with #runandtalk along with our Mental Health Ambassador Programme. We are passionate about the benefits running can bring to both physical and mental wellbeing and ensuring it is an activity that is accessible and beneficial to all. We hope that #runandtalk will help to breakdown some of the stigma attached to mental health and support people to access the social, physical and mental wellbeing benefits that running can bring.”**

Running is one of the most accessible and low cost ways to be active and meet government recommendations to be moderately active for at least 150 minutes per week. Whether it’s to get fit, improve health, make friends or take on a challenge running has something to offer everyone.
