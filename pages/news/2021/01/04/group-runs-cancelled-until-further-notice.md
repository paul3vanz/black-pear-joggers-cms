Following the latest government announcement we must cancel all group runs with immediate effect until further notice. You are still allowed to exercise with one other person so do make use of the [BPJ Running Buddies](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bpjrunningbuddies/) Facebook group if you want somebody to run with.

Please keep your eyes open here for any future updates. In the meantime, please keep running and stay safe.
