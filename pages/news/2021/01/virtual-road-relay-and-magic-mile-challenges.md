## 2) Magic mile

It's that time of year folks! Magic mile!! I challenge you all...

Let us get a benchmark for the new year. You have until Jan 10th to run a [magic mile](https://bpj.org.uk/magic-mile/).

It does not matter what pace you run; it is just a personal time. The aim is to improve the next one you do. The only rules are that It must be a whole mile, that does not have a minus elevation grade. (so, you cannot do downhill).

Below are 2 of the club's magic mile routes attached which are pretty flat. I am not sure what Pitchcroft is like now though sorry. You can either comment on the [BPJ Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/blackpearjoggers/permalink/10157898422088309/) with a pic of your time or just keep it to yourself, whatever you are comfortable with. Do not forget it's not to compare to others. Be proud of your time (even if it's not great because of the time of year).

Remember to do a warm up and cool down and lots of stretching afterwards. Good luck and have fun!!
