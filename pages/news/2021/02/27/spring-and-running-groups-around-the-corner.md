Following the government's [4-step plan to ease lockdown in England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021), we're cautiously optimistic on seeing the return of group runs next month. England Athletics have also released guidance on [how clubs should interpret the rules](https://www.englandathletics.org/athletics-and-running/news/guidance-update-2021/) at each stage.

The plans are all subject to change depending on government advice. Further updates will of course be published on the website and emailed to members.

## Current rules on groups

Current government guidance allows running with **one other person**, or with the people in your household/bubble. Please feel free to use the [BPJ Running Buddies](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bpjrunningbuddies/) group to find someone to run with. There have been reports of large groups seen out running. These are not BPJ groups and the club does not condone the breaking of any rules.

## Groups returning on 29th March

Following [Covid-secure guidelines](https://bpj.org.uk/health-and-safety-policy-and-risk-assessment/) as we did before, groups will return on **29th March**.

Groups of up to **10 plus the leader** will be available across a range of days, time, locations, paces and distances. Leaders will be free to limit groups to smaller groups as they feel comfortable or depending on the route.

## New improved group booking app

Members will be able to book groups using a new improved club app following our previous trial of the Wix platform.Â The new platform is easy to use for both runners and leaders and you can use a computer if you don't have a smartphone.

Full details will be announced by **19th March** while we're getting group leaders set up and trained. This will give you plenty of time to get set up.

## Normal club runs from 17th May

In line with the government's plans to further ease social contact restrictions outdoors, step 3 (currently **17th May**) is when we expect to reinstate the normal club runs from Perdiswell Leisure Centre, the University Riverside and of course the much-loved and much-missed Mug Run.

We will be discussing the finer details over the coming months and updating our risk assessments to ensure that club runs return safely and efficiently.

## 5K parkrun returns on 5th June

If you haven't already heard, parkrun HQ made a much anticipated announcement that from **5th June** parkrun in England will return with the 2K junior parkrun returning for 4-10 year old on **11th April**. parkrun this is great news for the running community.

We'll update you in due course. Until then, stay safe and we look forward to meeting again soon.
