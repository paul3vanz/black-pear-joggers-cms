To all BPJs,

Gay Grove has written some training plans for the autumn marathons (attached). We should be back to normal groups by the time they all kick in, but we are giving you them in advance just so you can see and maybe enter any races as part of your training.

Sunday mornings are our club's long run day of choice. When we are back to normal, Sunday runs will be marked out in various different distances starting from Perdiswell.

There will also be a Q and A session from your club's coaches. This is to get advice on training plans and nutrition.

There is also a complete beginner's plan to help you build your mileage from now until the plans kick in.

If your marathon isn't on the list, just change the dates to suit your plan.

Good luck!
