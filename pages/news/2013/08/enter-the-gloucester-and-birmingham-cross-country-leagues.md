After last year's success in the **Gloucester Cross Country League**, the club have decided to venture into the **Birmingham Cross Country League**. We have been entered into Division 3 and will be competing with the likes of Droitwich AC and Kidderminster and Stourport AC.

As a club we do intend to take part in the Gloucester League as well as the Birmingham League. The plus side with the Birmingham League is that the Club have already paid for the season so there will be no cost to the runners taking part in the Birmingham League. As for the Gloucester league it is a case of entering on the day for a very reasonable £3-4 or there is usually a special offer if you enter all four races prior to the event.

## The Teams

Senior men count 6 in a team, senior ladies count 3, vet ladies (i.e. anyone age 35 or over) count 3, vet men (i.e. anyone age 40 or over) count 4 in a team. The first 6/4/3 runners home count as your A team with the next 6/4/3 counting as the B team and so on.

Similar to last year all entries are as individuals and this covers all UKA age groups and U11’s i.e. over 8 on the day of the race. Masters awards will be decided in 5 year age groups. Timetables and maps of the course(s) will be emailed approximately one month before each of the events and will also be published here when received. Host clubs are therefore asked to send (email) the GAAA webmaster a copy of all their event info sent out to ensure web publication. As a rough guide to each days' programme of events should start at about midday with the last race starting at about 2:40pm.

League Rules will be published when known. Discounted pre-season entry form will be published here when available.
