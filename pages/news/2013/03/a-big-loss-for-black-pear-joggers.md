![Stuart Wild. 1947-2013. A true inspiration. Gone but never forgotten.](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Stuart-Wild-Montage.jpg)

Many of you have probably heard the really sad news that **Stuart Wild** passed away yesterday morning (1st March) while out walking with his wife Sian Wild.

Stuart was a true inspiration and will be sadly missed by all of us.

Everyone loved Stuart and all our thoughts are with his entire family. His family would like to thank everyone for their kind wishes and lovely memories that have been shared on the club [Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/blackpearjoggers/).

## Tribute

There will be a one minute silence at the start of Monday night's run as a mark of respect (4th March).

Also, as a show of club unity, several members are walking the Fernhill Heath four mile route that Stuart loved so much, stopping at the [White Hart](http://www.thewhitehartfernhillheath.co.uk/) for a drink in respect of the great man. He would have liked this; the ultimate muster! Stories can be shared on the route.

## Marathon man

> I think BPJ's doing long runs and races will always feel Stuartâ€™s enduring spirit supporting them. Our gratitude to him is endless. Peter Gilbert

Stuart had been with the club since its start as 'Worcester Joggers', supporting hundreds of members over the years with his Sunday morning [marathon training](https://bpj.org.uk/running-groups/marathon-training/), leading groups on club nights and convincing many into running their first marathon; himself completing his 100th marathon at Snowdonia in October 2012, with the club [celebrating his achievements](https://bpj.org.uk/featured-item/stuarts-100-marathon-celebrations/) and paying their respects for the support he has given.

The club will be paying respect to Stuart in many other ways over the coming time.
