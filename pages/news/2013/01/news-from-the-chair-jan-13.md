Hello all,

The 31 days of a wintery January soon get replaced by the 28 days of February, the month where romance takes over… maybe! Or it could be the time to sit down and watch 30 grown men running around the rugby pitch in the Six Nations, now for me that’s romance!!!

January has been a busy one for the club with people running the [Worcestershire Cross Country](https://bpj.org.uk/the-black-pear-joggers-at-cross-country-county-championships-2013/ "The Black Pear Joggers at Cross Country County Championships 2013"), the first weekend of the New Year conditions were hard going but we still managed to put out a Male and Female team. Well done all. After this event we were approved by the County and asked to pay a small fee to become affiliated to them. This will help to improve the club by making us eligible for inclusion in the team element of the cross country championships and the championships held over 10K, half marathon and multi-terrain distances. The club will also have a say in bi-monthly committee meetings held at Stone Manor and thus have the input to influence what happens within the County. The committee are looking for people who would be interested in going to these meeting and representing BPJ. If you would like to know more please speak to myself.

It was interesting to see that some of the BPJs have been following the Great Welsh and Lions coach in training in cryotherapy. OK so the weather was not -70°C and you were on the streets of Worcester, not in a cryotherapy chamber in Poland, but well done to all those members who set out and returned for a 10 mile run the other snowy Sunday morning.

I would also like to thank the members who attended the group leaders meeting on Monday night. We are always looking for new routes and people to lead groups so please come forward and help us. As a club we would like to try to keep group sizes to a maximum of 15 and I have been asked to mention that the club does not tolerate the use of iPods on club night. We feel that all members should be able to hear each other clearly for safety and social reasons.

Enjoy this romantic February,

Mike
