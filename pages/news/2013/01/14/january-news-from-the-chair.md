Hello,

A late, Happy New Year to all, the first 2 weeks of 2013 have flown by. The nights have started to slowly increase in light but the weather stays the same, wet and cold. Well it is still January!

This is a great time of the year to start those New Year resolutions, like your first run with the club, or first longer run for those of you planning on running a marathon this year. The long Sunday morning runs will benefit your running in 2013 whatever distance or goal you have this year. Thank you Stuart (Wild) for meeting at Perdiswell Leisure Centre every Sunday at 8.45am. The club would not run if it was not for the great group of volunteers we have. But as the club increases in size we will always need more. Group sizes on a Monday night are growing and it would be nice to see other people happy to help lead a group. (Most of you know Worcester well so thinking of a 4-7mile route for a Monday should be easy!)

We are holding a group leaders meeting on the 28th Jan (8.00ish), if you would like to attend please come along.

Thank you to Helen who for the past year has been the club secretary. Due to her busy work life she has had to stand down, Claire Shacklock has stood into this position in the interim period and any new nominations should be sent to April before the 1st February 2013.

The club’s cross country teams keep on improving and the number of runners has doubled since the first race in October. The club results are pushing the club forward and a few of the athletic clubs have been amazed with our efforts, WELL DONE ALL!

Thanks to all who helped organise the club’s cross-training event on Saturday night. The dancing and refreshments for the Christmas Party went down well. Maybe we need to use Whigfield’s ‘Saturday Night’ as a warm up on Mondays!?

Enjoy the rest of January,

Mike
