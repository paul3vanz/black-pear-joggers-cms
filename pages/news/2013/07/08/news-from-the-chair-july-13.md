Hello,

It’s the start of the month and time for an update.

If you’re like me then your running can easily take a dip over the next few months as you switch off and relax with the odd pint.  Probably all you can think about on your training runs is how the longest day of the year has now past and that the M5 will soon be grid locked with the school holiday traffic. It must therefore be time to enter a few races to keep the running interest up and I always think that July is a great time to do this.

As well as the ‘[The Stuart Wild Memorial Race](https://bpj.org.uk/wild-race/)’ on SUNDAY 21ST JULY there are a number of great races in Worcestershire for PBs or for the first timers. Evesham 10k and also the 13th Wyre Forest Trail Half Marathon is this weekend (7th July).  Following this there is a midweek 10k in Droitwich 10th July only £5.00 for attached club runners.  Dirt Run Summer Sizzler is on Friday 12th. Flat Worcester Pitchcroft 10K and Norton Fun Run 5/10k both 14th July.  Danny's Dash 8 mile Sunday 21st is in Stourport-on-Severn and on the Wednesday night also back in Stourport-on-Severn is The Fast and Furious 5km.  For those of you who are running the Thunder Run –it’s on Saturday 27th to Sunday 28th   GOOD LUCK!!   

I do have to ask the question each year why we have so many races this time of the year.  They seem to be a bit like buses!  

If you have run a few of these races I can understand why you would want to join us for the second [Summer Charity Ball](https://bpj.org.uk/featured-item/bpj-summer-ball-2013/ "BPJ Charity Ball 2013") with tickets on sale now for £25.  The event is back at the   Graeme Hick Pavilion at Worcestershire County Cricket Ground.  The room which has a great view of the cricket ground and the cathedral normally has a large amount of real ales on tap at the bar and will offer us all a chance to do our bit for charity. Gary Smith is to conduct an auction and is looking for members and their friends for their pledges, in order that we can raise as much money as possible for MNDA.  There will be music in the form of a Disco with our own club runner DJ Alex Kear playing sounds from the 50s to up to date hits.

I’d like to thank Group Leaders for their help and coming forward each Monday and Thursday nights. It’s great to have so many of you taking out groups at different paces and also trying out new routes as this really helps as the club grows. 

A few people still seem to be left in the dark on [membership](https://bpj.org.uk/membership/ "Membership") so please check the web site for more info BUT Membership runs from 1st April to 31st March. However, new members who join the club part way through the year will only pay a reduced amount according to the month in which they first join.

Enjoy July,

Mike  
Club Chairman
