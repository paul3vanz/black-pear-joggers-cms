Hello Black Pear Joggers,

If you’re looking for a night out on Wednesday 12th June and would like to end it with a pint and a BBQ our jogging friends in the hills (Malvern Joggers) are running their  fifth scenic summer evening 10k race.  The race HQ and registration will be at the Welland Village Hall, Marlbank Road, Welland, WR13 6NE, please see their [Malvern 10k website](http://www.malvernjoggers.co.uk/Page_10K.php) for more info.

The race takes in some breath-taking views with different terrains from start to finish and all runners are made very welcome.

## Kit

It’s been great to see so many of you out and about running again in May. BPJ kit is selling fast as more people enter races for the first time.  Jo Evans is selling kit, if you would like to order any [get in touch](https://bpj.org.uk/kit/ "Kit") with Jo and she will arrange to bring the kit to the next group meeting.   If you are thinking of racing soon it’s better to order now as certain sizes may sell out.

## Publicity

I would like to welcome Steve Jones on to [the committee](https://bpj.org.uk/the-committee/ "Meet the Joggers"), he will be helping Peter with publicity.  A big thanks from me and the rest of the committee for coming forward.  It’s also been great to see new people willing to take out running groups on a Monday night.  As the club keeps growing the help of the members is very welcome.

## Stuart Wild Memorial Race

Looking ahead I would like to wish all the best to The Stuart Wild Memorial Race TEAM which is running this event on SUNDAY 21ST JULY, all is crossed for the weather to stay dry for this! If you would like to enter please visit the [Stuart Wild Memorial Race](https://bpj.org.uk/wild-race/ "The Stuart Wild Memorial Race") page.

## Summer Charity Ball

The Summer Charity Ball is back after last year’s success with tickets now on sale for £25.  The event is at the Graeme Hick Pavilion at Worcestershire County Cricket Ground.  The room which has a great view of the cricket ground and the cathedral normally has a large amount of real ales on tap and will offer us all a chance to do our bit for charity.

Gary Smith is to conduct an auction and is looking for members and their friends for their pledges, in order that we can raise as much money as possible for MNDA.   There will be music in the form of a Disco with our own club runner DJ Alex Kear playing sounds from the 50s to up to date hits.

## Thursday Runs

This summer Thursday night runs are taking place back at the Mug House in Claines and other pubs around the city.  Graham and others will always be running from the Mug House at 7.15pm.  Other runs may happen on the same night so if you would like to join these please keep an eye on the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/blackpearjoggers/) for info.

I would also like to thank all paid up members and ask members who have not re-joined the club yet to [please pay](https://bpj.org.uk/membership/ "Joining the Club")!

Enjoy June... I hope to be back running with you all again soon.

Mike
