![Stuart Wild Race T-Shirt](https://bpj.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Stuart-Wild-Race-T-Shirt.jpg)As well as the normal Monday night groups, race director Gavin Paskin along with a group of helpers organised a practice run of the [Stuart Wild Memorial Race](https://bpj.org.uk/wild-race/) course this evening, with the actual race scheduled to take place in just over a month.

The route around the Perdiswell Golf Course was marked up, finish line flags erected and timers at the ready.

28 runners finished the practice two laps, with intense heat from the sun for most of the race. First male back was **Leo Taggio** in a time of 31:51 and first female was **Jemima Lowe** in 38:27. A special mention to **Ian Wild** who put in a great time and will be running the full marathon distance in honour of his Dad - Stuart Wild.

Well done to all who finished, especially those that haven't taken part in a timed event before.

## Enter the Race

Entries are still open for the race on the 21st July. It is ten 2.62 mile laps of Perdiswell Leisure Centre grounds and is open to entries of either individuals completing the full distance or to teams of 2 people or teams of 5 people as a relay event.
