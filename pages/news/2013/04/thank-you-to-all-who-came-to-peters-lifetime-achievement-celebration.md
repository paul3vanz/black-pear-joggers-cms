- Raffle and donations **£782**
- Auction **£305**
- So a grand total of **£1,087**

All proceeds from monies raised are going to Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association and St. Richard’s Hospice.

Lots of thank you's are due - Thank you to the Band "Breach Of The Peace" and Steve the lead singer who donated his part of the fee to our fundraising efforts.

Thanks to Alex Kear for the disco.

Thanks to Tracy Kennish, Paula Paskin and Naomi Smith for helping with the raffle.

Thanks to Gary Smith for a sterling job with the auction lots.

A big thanks to everyone who donated prizes for the raffle and for everyone who bought tickets.

Peter Gilbert was touched by the support shown by all the BPJ family and he enjoyed the evening very much.

Hope you all had a fantastic time because you all helped make it a great and memorable night.

There is no party like a BPJ party - Thanks everyone,

**Gavin**
