Regular 5 mile loop around the beautiful lanes, fields & along the old Droitwich canal & make it back before the 45 minute chimes.

There are also shorter routes at different paces and different group leaders to suit all abilities.

All welcome.

**Please note:** We will no longer be meeting at the Perdiswell Leisure Centre on Thursdays (until later in the year)
