42 Black Pear Joggers joined for a one mile timed run from Pitchcroft to see how fast they could run one mile. For some, this was a practice run for the [Marathon Talk Magic Mile Global Team Challenge](http://www.marathontalk.com/challenges/magic_mile.php), which will come some time later this year.

Runners wrote down their predicted times and then set off. **Claire Shacklock** and **Rebecca Jones** kindly took care of recording the times. At the finish line, the friendly Black Pears cheered on as the remaining runners finished.

The fastest male/female miles were **Dan Cale** (5:22) and **Jemima Lowe** (6:07). Closest to predicted time was **Lorraine Westcott**, who was two seconds outside, with a time of 6:42. Most improved from last year was **Dan Cale**, who has improved by 37 seconds.

There may be additional magic mile practice runs put on throughout the year, keep an eye on the website and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/blackpearjoggers/) for details.
