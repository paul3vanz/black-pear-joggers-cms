Hello all,

I hope you have all enjoyed the summer! On a personal note, it has been nice to get back to competing in a few more events than the past few years.  It’s been very encouraging to see so many of you doing different events.  In the past few weeks I have seen and heard of people taking part in Monday night’s ‘Battle of Worcester History Run’ led by Duncan Sutcliffe, 5K and 10K races, half marathons, full marathons, triathlons, and ultra-marathons.  Also I found out that Georgie Dragon of Worcester Football Club is a paid up member of BPJ and came 6th in the Mascots Race at Worcester Races’ family fun day.  We really are a club which caters for all!

## The Wild One

Your support for ‘[The Wild One](https://bpj.org.uk/2014/07/thank-you-for-supporting-the-2014-wild-one-race/ "Thank you for supporting the 2014 Wild One race")’ event was outstanding and a great day was had by all. The club's annual race at [Croome Park](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/croome-race/ "Croome Capability Canter") was sold out in record time.  If you’re not running, I would ask for you to keep the date free in your diary (Sunday, 30th November), as we will need a large number of marshals to run this event.

## Cross Country Leagues

In a few weeks the [cross country](https://bpj.org.uk/leagues/cross-country/ "Cross Country") season starts. The races in the Birmingham league are free to all BPJ members. [Club colours](https://bpj.org.uk/kit/ "Kit") are to been worn on these events and a pair of spikes could be useful for the winter muddy runs. We will also be taking part in the Gloucestershire league and there will be a small cost to enter these runs.  I would like to say thank you to Lorraine Griffiths and also to Chris Bomber Harris for taking on the captainship for their respected gender.  Good luck to all.

If you are interested in racing in the cross country, find out more on the [cross country](https://bpj.org.uk/leagues/cross-country/ "Cross Country") page.

## Committee

The committee are looking for some members to help us keep the website up-to-date. So if you have thought about writing a report, TV style talk or podcast for any events which are of interest to us please forward them on to our webmaster, [Paul Evans](https://bpj.org.uk/contact-the-club/ "Contact the Club").

## Winter

As we head into the darker nights I would like to mention that the club does not condone the use of ipods on club nights  we feel that all members should be able to hear each other for safety and  social reasons.  I would also like to ask any new group leaders to please come forward, this will help us to try and keep our group sizes to a maximum of 15.

Enjoy the next few weeks, happy running,

Mike
