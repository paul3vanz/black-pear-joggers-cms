This year's [Croome Capability Canter](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/croome-race/ "Croome Capability Canter") race sold out in a record four days. The 6.5 mile (10kish) multi-terrain race around the scenic Croome Park; designed by renowned 18th century landscape architect Lancelot “Capability” Brown has proved extremely popular and was even voted into the top 10 off-road races by readers of Runners World.

We are currently looking for volunteers to help out on the day, so if you are interested, [get in touch](https://bpj.org.uk/contact-the-club/ "Contact the Club").
