Club member Graham Harris is organising another Christmas run and get together on **Saturday 27th December**.

It's a 10K run for all abilities round the lanes of north Worcester then after for drinks at the Mug Inn pub. All welcome and this is going to be a steady run with lots of mustering.

Meet on the corner of **St. John Baptist Church, Claines, Worcester, WR3 7RN** at **11:05am** for **11:20am** start.  This should give enough time for those doing [Worcester parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/worcester/) to still attend the run.

If you have any questions, come and chat on our [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/blackpearjoggers/) group or speak to Graham on a club night.
