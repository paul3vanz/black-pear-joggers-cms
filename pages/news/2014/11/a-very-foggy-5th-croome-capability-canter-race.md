Hundreds descended upon a very foggy morning at the National Trust location ready for the 5th Croome Capability Canter; the Black Pear Joggers' annual 6.5M off-road race around the scenic Croome Park. This year's 300 entries sold out in a record 4 days, highlighting how popular the race has become.

There was a great crowd of runners from the usual suspects, the Black Pear Joggers (with many more marshaling), Malvern Joggers (marking Steve Roode's 1000th kilometre of racing this year for charity) and the ever-growing friendly Pershore Plum Plodders. There was also a record turnout from Tewkesbury AC (34 runners) and Kings Heath RC (24 runners).

Finishers were rewarded with a medal, goodie bag and a commemorative sports water bottle to mark the 5th year of the race.

Winner of last year's race Daniel Geisler (Worcester AC) returned to keep the title, beating last year's time by 10 seconds. First BPJ home was Ian Wild, who narrowly missed out of 3rd place, while in the female category, Black Pear Joggers Victoria Watkins and Anna Borecka landed 1st and 3rd place respectively, a great result for them and the club.

Proceeds from the race will be donated to Croome Park with total amounts yet to be finalised.

Thank you to everyone who helped make the race another success, bring on next year and hopefully less fog!
