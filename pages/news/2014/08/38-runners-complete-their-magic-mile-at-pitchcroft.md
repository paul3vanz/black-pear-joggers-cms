Over 60 runners across two days (BPJs and some Malvern Joggers) joined for a one mile timed run from Pitchcroft as part of the [Marathon Talk Magic Mile Global Team Challenge 2014](http://www.marathontalk.com/challenges/magic_mile.php), giving people the chance to see how fast they can run a mile. Runners of all abilities timed themselves running a mile around the perimeter of the racecourse.

There were some superb times, with an average mile time of **6 minutes 53 seconds**. Many surprised themselves by running much quicker than their predicted times.

Thanks to Claire Shacklock and Hazel Sherrington for organising the event and Anthony Jones for taking some photos (featuring some very pained expressions!), which can be found on the [BPJ Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=oa.10152262491938309&type=1).
