## Website

Hello Joggers,

I would first like to thank Paul for all his hard work in keeping the website up and running.  As most of you are aware the web site lost contact with the outside world at the end of May due to some technical hitches.  However luckily for us Paul had a long weekend on the phone and his laptop sorting the problems out. Thanks again!

## Social

The summer social night at the T20 cricket the other night was a wash out, and we had to leave the ground without a ball being bowled.

The committee are now looking for a new BPJ volunteer to enter into this fun role of club social chair, the role would involve sorting out different social activities for club members.  This vacancy has appeared as Dan and Jay have both had to step down due to work commitments, I would like to thank them both for their hard work over the past year.

If you are interested in this role, [let me know](mailto:chair@blackpearjoggers.org.uk).

## The Wild One

The club’s [Wild One Race](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/wild-race/ "The Wild One: Multi Lap Marathon") is filling up very fast, Claire and the race committee are working hard to ensure all will go well on the day.  We are lucky to have [Startin Honda](http://www.startingroup.co.uk/honda/) and [Youthcomm Radio](http://youthcomm.co.uk/) on board to help us plug this event around the city.

## Croome Capability Canter

I can also now reveal that the race licence for this year's [Croome Capability Canter](https://bpj.org.uk/our-races/croome-race/ "Croome Capability Canter") has been approved for the 30th November, the club will be holding its annual Monday night practice run around the course on Monday 28th July (meet at 6:45pm). It is a fantastic opportunity to run around this National Trust location. Entry for the main race will be shortly after the Wild One has finished.

## Club Size

The club size has increased in the last year by approximately 20%.  It’s been great to see that the club members are helping us maintain the club's friendly environment by providing so many different distance and speed running groups on a Monday night.  We would like to try to keep group sizes to a maximum of 15 so please take a group out from time to time and thanks group leaders for your continued support.

## Races

The racing bug is hitting a large number of people in the club. Some people are participating in some crazy events from ultra-Marathons, 24 hour races, Mud runners etc, to the more normal 5K, 10k and half marathons.  The club has seen some great results with the Black Pear Jogger’s colours taking first and second in the Malvern 10k (James Smith and Ian Radford).  Staying in Malvern the **boy**s Clive Andrews, Jamie Warner, Alan Southwick took the team prize in the Malvern Half.  A large number of members are also running their first 5k, 10k and half Marathons this summer as well.  GOOD LUCK to all!!!

 I would like to recommend a mid-week race in Droitwich for only £5 on Wednesday 9th July 2014 at 7.30pm, see Droitwich AC website for more info.

If some of you enjoy your Sunday morning lie-ins and not sure whether to take part in the Evesham 10 or not, another alternative would be the Timberhonger 10k in Bromsgrove on Saturday, 12th July with a much more civilised 6pm start.

## Chip Night

The 14th July is the return of free chips in the bar; it would be good to see you for a pint and a chip butty.

Enjoy the next few weeks,

Mike
