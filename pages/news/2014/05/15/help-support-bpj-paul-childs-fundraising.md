As a few of you may know, I run the London Marathon for various charities each year. I have also run in a couple of 24hr races, these have been for a charity very close to me. I now predominately run for a charity; [Niamh’s Next Step](http://www.niamhsnextstep.com/).

This charity was set up by Niamh’s parents in memory of their very brave little girl who lost her 18 month fight against childhood Cancer, **Neuroblastoma**.

Neuroblastoma is a rare cancer that affects children. It develops from nerve cells called neuroblasts. The cancer usually starts in the child’s abdomen (tummy). It often develops in the adrenal glands, the two small glands above the kidneys, and can spread to other areas such as the bones, liver and skin. Neuroblastoma usually affects around 100 children in the uk each year.

This year I have decided to try and raise even more money for this charity by pushing myself just a little bit more :0)

I have already run the [Bath Half Marathon](http://bathhalf.co.uk/), [London Marathon](http://www.virginmoneylondonmarathon.com/) and [Malvern Hills Ultra](http://www.ultrarunningltd.co.uk/malvern-hills-ultra.html) so far this year. Next on the agenda is the [Grand Union Canal race](http://www.gucr.co.uk/), a 145 mile run that I have to try and complete in 45 hours. I will also be running the [Wales trail marathon](http://www.trailmarathonwales.com/), [TR24](http://www.tr24.co.uk/), [Thames Path 184 miler](http://www.t184.co.uk/) and the [Berlin Marathon](http://www.bmw-berlin-marathon.com/en/).

I would really appreciate any support and donations throughout these events, you can even keep me company or some or all of my training runs if you feel adventurous :0)

You can donate by visiting [my JustGiving site](http://www.justgiving.com/pacmanruns) or via text to **70070** with the words **PMAN84** and the amount **£1**, **£3**, **£5**, etc.

Anyway that you can help I would really appreciate it :0)

Thanks everyone.

Paul Childs
